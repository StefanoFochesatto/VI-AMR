\begin{abstract}
Free-boundary problems posed as variational inequalities, including obstacle problems, appear in many scientific and engineering applications.  In the finite element solution of these problems, the geometrical error in locating the unknown free boundary often dominates the overall numerical error.  In this paper we propose, and implement using the Firedrake finite element library, parallel adaptive mesh refinement strategies which enhance mesh resolution around the free boundary.  These methods mark elements for refinement based on a computed solution.  We consider three methods: (i) an unstructured dilation operator which computes discrete adjacency to the computed free-boundary; (ii) a variable-coefficient diffusion method which thresholds a diffused indicator function for the computed active set; and (iii) a metric-based method which averages an anisotropic, Hessian-derived Riemannian metric with an isotropic metric computed from the same diffused indicator.  Hybrid strategies, which add classical \emph{a posteriori} error estimators within the computed inactive sets, are also proposed.  These methods are evaluated by norm error, or free-boundary localization error (Jaccard or Hausdorff distances), versus mesh complexity and run-time.  Applications include classical Laplacian obstacle problems and a shallow ice flow problem for predicting the glaciated region in a mountain range.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The classical Laplacian obstacle problem \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980} finds the equilibrium position (vertical displacement) $u$ of an elastic membrane over some domain $\Omega \subset \RR^d$.  The membrane, attached with displacement $g$ at the fixed boundary $\partial\Omega$ and subjected to an applied force $f$, is constrained to be above a given obstacle $\psi$.  The strong formulation of this problem is this complementarity problem over $\Omega$:
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:classical:ncp}
\begin{align}
  -\nabla^2 u - f \geq 0 \label{eq:classical:ncp:a} \\
  u - \psi \geq 0\\
  (-\nabla^2u - f)(u - \psi) = 0 \label{eq:classical:ncp:c}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
From a solution to \eqref{eq:classical:ncp}, or rather from solving its weak form (given momentarily), we may identify the inactive and active sets,
\begin{equation}
  I_u = \{x \in \Omega \,:\, u(x) > \psi(x)\}, \quad A_u = \Omega \setminus I_u, \label{eq:classical:sets}
\end{equation}
and the free boundary
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_u = \Omega \cap \partial I_u. \label{eq:classical:freeboundary}
\end{equation}
Note that $u$ solves the Poisson equation $-\nabla^2u = f$ on $I_u$, the interior condition of the free-boundary problem.  Both Dirichlet ($u=\psi$) and Neumann ($\partial u/\partial n = \partial \psi/\partial n$) conditions apply along the unknown set $\Gamma_u$, but only Dirichlet conditions hold on $\partial\Omega$.

For the example shown in Figure \ref{fig:ball}, $A_u$ is a disc and $\Gamma_u=\partial A_u$ is a circle.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{static/obstacle65.pdf}
\caption{A classical obstacle problem with a hemispherical obstacle.}
\label{fig:ball}
\end{figure}

Another physical interpretation of problem \eqref{eq:classical:ncp} is where $u$ models the pressure in a porous dam, which cannot go below zero ($\psi=0$); see examples in \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993} and \cite{Bueler2021}.

As is well-known, problem \eqref{eq:classical:ncp} has a weak formulation which is a variational inequality (VI) over a Sobolev space.  Let $\cX=H^1(\Omega)$ \cite{ElmanSilvesterWathen2014} and suppose $\psi \in \cX \cap C(\bar\Omega)$.  (If it were a faithful visualization, Figure \ref{fig:ball} would show $\psi$ as an upper hemisphere extended continuously to $\partial\Omega$.)  Let $g:\partial \Omega\to \RR$ be continuous, with $g\ge\psi|_{\partial \Omega}$.  Let
\begin{equation} \label{eq:classical:admissible}
\cK = \{u \in \cX \,:\, u \ge \psi \text{ and } u|_{\partial \Omega} = g\}
\end{equation}
be the admissible subset, closed and convex in $\cX$.  For $f\in L^2(\Omega)$, the VI formulation of the obstacle problem \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980} finds $u\in \cK$ so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:classical:vi}
\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla(v - u) \ge \int_\Omega f(v - u) \quad \text{ for all } v \in \cK.
\end{equation}

Section \ref{sec:vifem} will recall some of the theory of such VIs, and of their finite element (FE) approximation.  However, we will generalize from elliptic bilinear forms, as in \eqref{eq:classical:vi}, to coercive nonlinear operators over Banach spaces.  A conforming FE approximation $u_h$ of the VI solves the same weak form, but now over a finite-dimensional admissible set constructed on a mesh $\cT_h$.  Similarly to Cea's lemma for PDEs \cite{ElmanSilvesterWathen2014}, the norm errors $\|u-u_h\|$ can be bounded \emph{a priori} by extending the Falk \cite{Falk1974} technique to nonlinear operators (Theorem \ref{thm:genfalk}).  These norm errors are controlled by the approximation properties of the FE space, but subject to additional VI-specific concerns regarding admissibility and the construction of the FE obstacle.

Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) uses \emph{a posteriori} information from a coarser-mesh calculation to strategically add elements to a mesh, to reduce numerical error.  For VI problems the geometrical error in locating the free-boundary $\Gamma_u$ on a given mesh can, by itself, influence the global error $\|u-u_h\|$.  This fact, somewhat acknowledged in the FE literature for VIs \cite{Suttmeier2008}, is clearly seen in the following 1D example.

\begin{example} \label{example:oned} Suppose $\Omega = (-1,1)$, $\psi(x)=0.5 - x^2$, $f=0$, and $g=0$.  The exact solution $u$ of \eqref{eq:classical:vi} for this data is easily calculated.  Free boundaries are at $x_*=\pm(1-2^{-1/2})$ (Figure \ref{fig:parabola}).  For an FE approximation using piecewise-linear elements and a uniform mesh, let $\Delta_h$ be the minimum distance between a node and $x_*$.  Noting that $x_*$ are irrational, under uniform refinements $\Delta_h = O(h)$ is an irregular function of $h$.  Figure \ref{fig:parabola} (right) compares $H^1$ and $L^2$ norm errors to $\Delta_h$.  The erratic behavior of the norm errors closely follows the purely-geometrical free-boundary location error $\Delta_h$. \end{example}

\begin{figure}[ht]

}
\caption{A one-dimensional obstacle problem (left), for which the geometrical free-boundary location error $\Delta_h$ predicts norm error $\|u-u_h\|$ behavior (right).}
\label{fig:parabola}
\end{figure}

A small modification of Example \ref{example:oned} illustrates another aspect of obstacle problems, namely that the sets $A_u,I_u,\Gamma_u$ are generally \emph{not} continuous functions of the data.

\begin{example} \label{example:notcontinuous} Suppose we change Example \ref{example:oned} by setting $g=-0.5$, so that $g=\psi$ on $\partial\Omega$.  For $\eps\in\RR$ we define a new source term $f_\eps(x)=2+\eps$.  An easy calculation shows that for $\eps\le 0$ the solution is $u_\eps=\psi$, thus $A_{u_\eps}=\Omega$ and $I_{u_\eps}=\emptyset$.  However, for $\eps>0$, so that $f_\eps$ represents sufficient upward force on the membrane to lift it off the obstacle, we find the solution satisfies $u_\eps(x)=\psi(x) + 0.5\, \eps\, (1-x^2) > \psi(x)$ for all $x\in\Omega$.  Thus $A_{u_\eps}=\emptyset$ and $I_{u_\eps}=\Omega$ for $\eps>0$, so these sets are discontinuous functions at $\eps=0$. \end{example}

By definition, the $\eps=0$ case of Example \ref{example:notcontinuous} is \emph{degenerate} \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}, that is, the unconstrained solution happens to match the obstacle.  This example shows that any predictable convergence results for FE approximations of the solution-dependent sets $A_u,I_u,\Gamma_u$ will depend upon nondegeneracy assumptions of some kind.

In fact, the effectiveness of different AMR strategies for VI problems depends upon the measure (area or volume) of the active and inactive sets.  This observation motivates the \emph{a posteriori} considerations in Section \ref{sec:aposteriori}.  For certain obstacle-type problems, specifically those with a ``blistering'' property, elements significantly interior to the active set may require no further computation or refinement.  For such problems, if a solution is desired at higher resolution within the active set where $u=\psi$ then this can be computed in post-processing by arbitrary interpolation of the obstacle.  That is, $\psi$ has already been provided in the data of the problem.

\begin{example} \label{example:activesets} Examples in Section \ref{sec:results} will measure convergence rates for three 2D classical obstacle problems.  Figure \ref{fig:activesizes} shows high-resolution active sets for these examples.  For the right-most case, with a large active set, we will see that most of the performance benefit of our preferred AMR techniques, relative to uniform refinement, comes from avoiding refinement in the active set.  This benefit also dominates performance gains in our glaciation application (Section \ref{sec:app}). \end{example}

\end{figure}

In this work we consider only $P_1$ element spaces over meshs of triangles or tetrahedra, and only $h$-refinement is addressed.  VIs can be solved using $p$-refinement and higher-order elements, but only if nontrivial monotonicity modifications are made \cite{KeithSurowiec2024}, which is not attempted here.  Also, note that the classical obstacle problem in VI form \eqref{eq:classical:vi} is equivalent to constrained minimization of a scalar objective.  However, the analysis of FE errors for VI problems presented in Sections \ref{sec:vifem} and \ref{sec:aposteriori} does not require such an objective, nor do our AMR strategies exploit such (if available).  Indeed, no objective exists for the application in Section \ref{sec:app}.

Three AMR methods for VIs are described in Section \ref{sec:viamr}.  Our implementations use the Firedrake finite element library \cite{Rathgeberetal2016} and produce conforming meshes with no hanging nodes.  The first two methods are of tag-and-refine type, only differing by which elements are tagged.  For these methods skeleton-based refinement \cite{PlazaCarey2000} is applied after tagging, as implemented within PETSc's DMPlex component \cite{petsc-user-ref} or the Netgen library \cite{Betteridgeetal2024}.  The third goal-oriented and metric-based method uses the Netgen \cite{Wallworketal2020} and Animate libraries for metric computations and the MMG library \cite{DapognyDobrzynskiFrey2014} for refinement.

Full details are given in Section \ref{sec:viamr}, but here is a high-level view of the methods:

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\emph{\roman{enumi})}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The unstructured dilation operator (UDO) method discretely identifies elements adjacent to the computed free boundary, employing a graph-based approach to tag neighboring elements for refinement.  It generalizes the bit-map image processing operation of dilation \cite{Pratt1991} to unstructured meshes.
\item The variable-coefficient diffusion (VCD) method starts from a node-wise indicator function for the current computed active set.  This indicator becomes the initial iterate in a single step of a time-dependent heat equation problem.  Solving this problem smooths the indicator about the free boundary.  The smoothed indicator is then averaged over each element and thresholded for element tagging.
\item The averaged-metric (AVM) method computes an intermediate representation of the size, shape, and orientation of the new mesh, as a tensor-valued Riemannian metric \cite{Alauzet2010}.  The metric in this method is an average the Hessian of the computed solution with an isotropic metric generated from the same diffused active set indicator as in \emph{ii)}.  This permits controlled anisotropy \cite{Wallworketal2020} to reduce inactive set solution norm error, while approximately maintaining mesh complexity.
\end{enumerate}

Our numerical results in Sections \ref{sec:results} and \ref{sec:app}, generated by applying these three strategies, will justify our somewhat-heuristic approach to AMR for VIs.  Because the convergence of VI problems is dominated by the error in approximating the free boundary, an AMR scheme that quickly concentrates effort around an accurately-computed free boundary, possibly augmented by PDE-type error estimators in the inactive set (Section \ref{sec:aposteriori}), will accelerate convergence and reduce unnecessary computation.

AMR for VI problems has been preliminarily explored in the literature.  The first published analysis may be \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993}, giving an error bound for the classical obstacle problem in terms of local functionals associated with each element.  The monograph by Suttmeier \cite{Suttmeier2008} covers a broader class of problems, including elasticity.  For the classical obstacle problem, the constructable error estimators in these works require heuristic assumptions which may not hold in general.  (See inequality (42) in \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993}, and the approximation ``$(u-\psi)\lambda_h\approx 0$'' in \cite{Suttmeier2008}.)  To our knowledge these approaches are not found in publicly-available implementations, nor are they as efficient, for computing high-resolution approximations to free boundaries, as the best of our strategies.

Our focus in this paper is on AMR performance, but not solver performance.  We use a fixed, VI-adapted, reduced-space Newton method with line search \cite{BensonMunson2006}, implemented in PETSc \cite{petsc-user-ref}, for all examples.  Note that since the constraint $u \geq \psi$ makes VI problems nonlinear, even if the operator is linear, an iterative solver like Newton is required.  Such a numerical method cannot converge quadratically until the active and inactive sets stabilize on the given mesh, equivalently once the discrete free boundary is identified.  At that point convergence can occur in one additional iteration, for a linear operator, or otherwise in a few iterations for well-behaved nonlinear operators.  Such a reduced-space Newton solver can only adjust the approximated free boundary by one-cell per iteration \citep{GraeserKornhuber2009}, and thus overall convergence becomes proportional to the number of grid spaces between the initial-iterate and final free boundaries on the mesh \citep{Bueler2021}.

VI solver performance can be substantially improved by combining the AMR meshing strategies here with a multilevel approach.  The solver in \cite{BuelerFarrell2024}, for example, uses coarse meshes to make large geometrical corrections in the free boundary.  This path, which promises highly-scalable solutions of obstacle problems, is for future research.

To conclude this introduction, there are two overall features of the AMR methods of this paper:
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\arabic{enumi}.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Relative to uniform refinement, the methods exhibit significant improvements in error norm convergence.  This is measured, per mesh degree of freedom, by norm error $\|u-u_h\|$ or free-boundary localization (geometrical) error.
\item Their implementations (\href{https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/VI-AMR}{\texttt{github.com/StefanoFochesatto/VI-AMR}}), extending the widely-distributed Firedrake \cite{Langeetal2016} FE library, are parallel, well-documented, and easy-to-use.
\end{enumerate}

The paper is organized as follows:  Table \ref{tab:abbrev} gives the few abbreviations used herein.  Section \ref{sec:vifem} provides \emph{a priori} norm bounds for FE methods applied to VI problems.  Section \ref{sec:aposteriori} addresses \emph{a posteriori} error estimators which can be applied in the inactive set, and it identifies problems where active-set refinement can be avoided.  Section \ref{sec:viamr} describes the three methods in more detail.  Sections \ref{sec:results}--\ref{sec:conclusion} compare and discuss the performance of these AMR algorithms on model problems, and on a realistic glacier application.

\section{Variational inequalities and their finite element approximations} \label{sec:vifem}

We start with the VI formulation of unilateral obstacle problems in Banach spaces.  Consider a bounded, open domain $\Omega \subset \RR^d$, $d=2,3$, with Lipschitz boundary \cite{Ciarlet2002}.  We assume that $\Omega$ is polygonal or polyhedral.  Let $\cX = W^{1,p}(\Omega)$, $p>1$, be the Sobolev space of measurable functions with $p$th-integrable gradients \cite{Evans2010}.  We will assume continuous problem data, allowing well-defined point values, so suppose $\psi \in \cX \cap C(\bar\Omega)$ and $g\in C(\partial \Omega)$ satisfy $g \ge \psi|_{\partial\Omega}$.  Define the admissible subset
\begin{equation} \label{eq:admissible}
\cK = \{v \in \cX \,:\, v \ge \psi \text{ and } v|_{\partial \Omega} = g\},
\end{equation}
as for \eqref{eq:classical:admissible}.  Note that $\cK\subset \cX$ is closed and convex.  Observe that generally $\psi\notin\cK$.

Let $\cX'$ be the dual space of $\cX$, with the application of $\omega \in \cX'$ to $v\in \cX$ denoted $\omega[v] \in \RR$.  The norm on $\cX$ is denoted $\|\cdot\|$, while for $\cX'$ it is $\|\omega\|' = \sup_{\|v\|=1} |\omega[v]|$.  Let $F:\cK \to \cX'$ be a given operator, generally nonlinear, and let $\ell\in \cX'$ be given.  The VI associated to this data, a unilateral obstacle problem, is to find $u\in \cK$ so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:vi}
F(u)[v - u] \ge \ell[v - u] \quad \text{ for all } v \in \cK.
\end{equation}

Our VI problems can be analyzed within the framework of coercivity and Lipschitz continuity.  We say $F$ is $q$-coercive, $1<q<\infty$, if there is $\alpha>0$ so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:coercive}
(F(v) - F(w))[v - w] \ge \alpha \|v-w\|^q
\end{equation}
for all $v,w \in \cK$.  Note that if $F$ is $q$-coercive then it is also strictly monotone: $(F(v) - F(w))[v - w] > 0$ for $v\ne w$.  Let $B_R(0)$ be the origin-centered open ball in $\cX$ of radius $R>0$.  We say $F$ is Lipschitz on bounded subsets if there is $C(R)>0$ so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lipschitz}
\|F(v)-F(w)\|' \le C(R) \|v-w\|
\end{equation}
for all $v,w \in B_R(0)\cap \cK$.  If $F$ satisfies \eqref{eq:lipschitz} then it is continuous.

From the coercivity, strict monotonicity, and continuity of $F$ it follows that a unique solution to \eqref{eq:vi} exists \cite[Corollary III.1.8]{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}.

\begin{example}  \label{example:classicalobstacle}
In the classical obstacle problem \eqref{eq:classical:vi}, over $\cX=H^1(\Omega)=W^{1,2}(\Omega)$,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:classical:bilinearform}
F(u)[v] = a(u,v) = \int_\Omega \grad u\cdot \grad v\,dx
\end{equation}
is in fact bilinear.  It is $2$-coercive because the Laplacian is uniformly elliptic \cite{Evans2010}, and it is Lipschitz over $\cX$ with constant $C=1$.
\end{example}

While $F$ in Example \ref{example:classicalobstacle} is defined on all of $\cX$, the general operator $F$ in \eqref{eq:vi} might be only defined on $\cK$.  Section \ref{sec:app} provides such an example.

Note that if the inequality constraint in \eqref{eq:vi} were absent then the residual would be zero almost everywhere ($F(u)-\ell=0$); this is the PDE case.  However, for a VI, over $\cK$ defined by \eqref{eq:admissible}, we only have that $F(u)-\ell=0$ a.e.~within the unknown inactive set $I_u$.  In fact, the residual $F(u)-\ell\in \cX'$ might be highly-irregular in the active set $A_u$, but it is at least nonnegative.  The following lemma states the (weak) complementarity property associated to VI \eqref{eq:vi}; compare strong-form complementarity \eqref{eq:classical:ncp} for \eqref{eq:classical:vi}.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:measure}\cite[Theorem II.6.9]{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}.  Suppose $u\in \cK$ solves \eqref{eq:vi}.  Then $F(u)-\ell=d\mu_u$ is a positive Radon measure supported in the active set $A_u$.  Thus for $w\in\cX$ we have
\begin{equation}
(F(u)-\ell)[w] = \int_{A_u} w\, d\mu_u. \label{eq:measure}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

Now let $\cT_h$ be a shape-regular mesh partition (triangulation, etc.) of $\Omega$ \cite{AinsworthOden2000,ElmanSilvesterWathen2014}.  Let $\cX_h \subset \cX \cap C(\bar\Omega)$ be a conforming finite-dimensional FE subspace over $\cT_h$.  (Our examples will be piecewise-linear: $\cX_h=P_1$.)  Assume that there is $g_h\in\cX_h$ such that $g_h=g$ exactly along $\partial \Omega$.  Let $\psi_h \in \cX_h$ be the FE obstacle, which satisfies the compatibility requirement $\psi_h \le g_h$ along $\partial\Omega$; note that no other requirement, for now, relates $\psi_h$ to $\psi$.  Define the (nonempty) FE admissible set
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fe:admissible}
\cK_h = \{v_h \in \cX_h \,:\, v_h \ge \psi_h \text{ and } v_h|_{\partial \Omega} = g_h|_{\partial\Omega}\}.
\end{equation}
Our FE method seeks $u_h\in\cK_h$ satisfying the VI problem
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fe:vi}
F(u_h)[v_h - u_h] \ge \ell[v_h - u_h] \quad \text{ for all } v_h \in \cK_h.
\end{equation}
The same argument given for \eqref{eq:vi} shows that \eqref{eq:fe:vi} has a unique solution $u_h$.  Define
\begin{equation}
  I_u^h = \{x \in \Omega \,:\, u_h(x) > \psi_h(x)\}, \quad A_u^h = \Omega \setminus I_u^h, \label{eq:fe:sets}
\end{equation}
the numerical inactive and active sets, respectively, defined \emph{a posteriori} from the solution to \eqref{eq:fe:vi}.

Because $\cK_h \subset \cX_h \subset \cX$, we may regard \eqref{eq:fe:vi} as a conforming FE method for \eqref{eq:vi}.  However, this is subtle for an obstacle problem, depending on the relationship between $\psi$ and $\psi_h$.  If $\psi_h$ is an interpolant of $\psi$, $\psi_h = \Pi_h \psi$, then $\cK_h \approx \cK$ in some sense, but one may state three precise levels of ``conforming admissibility'':
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\emph{\roman{enumi})}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\cK_h \not \subset \cK$
\item $\cK_h \subset \cK$
\item $\cK_h = \cK \cap \cX_h$
\end{enumerate}
As noted early-on by Ciarlet \cite[Figure 5.1.3]{Ciarlet2002}, situation \emph{i)} generally applies for an interpolated obstacle $\psi_h = \Pi_h \psi$, e.g.~for $\cX_h=P_1$ and when $\psi$ is not convex.  Situation \emph{ii)} holds when $\psi_h \ge \psi$, which can be imposed by using a monotone injection operator, e.g.~``$\psi_h = R^\oplus \psi$'' in the notation from \cite{BuelerFarrell2024}.  (For related ideas, see the proof of Theorem 5.1.2 in \cite{Ciarlet2002}, and \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}.)  The strongest condition \emph{iii)} holds if $\psi_h=\psi$ exactly, for example when $\psi=0$ in the porous dam problems considered by \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993}.

Note that the obstacle $\psi$ is given \emph{as data} for VI problem \eqref{eq:vi}.  Point values of $\psi$ can therefore be evaluated as desired to represent (improve) $u_h$ within the numerical active set $A_u^h$.  That is, over elements where there is believed to be active-set agreement, i.e.~$K\in\cT_h$ such that $K \subset A_u \cap A_u^h$, reducing the error $e=u-u_h=\psi-u_h$ can be addressed in post-processing simply by evaluating the data $\psi$.  By contrast, improvement of the mesh, and re-solution of the FE problem, is needed to more-accurately locate the free boundary and reduce $\|e\|$.  Convergence also requires more-accurate FE solution within the inactive set, e.g.~using mesh refinement.  However, refinement deeper within a stabilized active set may be wasted effort.

The following \emph{a priori} theorem, which bounds the norm of $e=u-u_h$, generalizes Falk \cite{Falk1974}; see also Theorem 5.1.1 in \cite{Ciarlet2002}.  In applying it we will distinguish between numerical errors arising from mis-locating the exact free boundary, thus mis-identifying the exact active and inactive sets, versus the question of accurate approximation of the original obstacle $\psi$ within the active set.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:genfalk}  For $1<q<\infty$, define the conjugate exponent $q'=q/(q-1)$.  Assume that $F$ is $q$-coercive and Lipschitz on bounded sets of its domain.  Suppose $u\in\cK$ solves \eqref{eq:vi} and $u_h\in\cK_h$ solves \eqref{eq:fe:vi}.  Let $R_h=\max\{\|u\|,\|u_h\|\}$.  Then there is a constant $c(R_h)>0$, not otherwise depending on $u$ or $u_h$, so that
\begin{align}
\|u-u_h\|^q &\le \frac{2}{\alpha} \bigg( \inf_{v\in\cK} \int_{A_u} (v-u_h)\,d\mu_u \label{eq:falk} \\
   &\qquad\quad + \inf_{v_h\in\cK_h} \int_{A_u} (v_h-\psi)\,d\mu_u \notag \\
   &\qquad\quad + c(R_h) \inf_{v_h\in\cK_h} \|v_h - u\|^{q'}\bigg). \notag
\end{align}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}  For arbitrary $v\in\cK$ and $v_h\in\cK_h$, rewrite \eqref{eq:vi} and \eqref{eq:fe:vi} as $F(u)[u] \le F(u)[v] + \ell[u-v]$ and $F(u_h)[u_h] \le F(u_h)[v_h] + \ell[u_h-v_h]$, respectively.  It follows from these inequalities, and $q$-coercivity of $F$, that
\begin{align}
\alpha \|u-u_h\|^q &\le \left(F(u)-F(u_h)\right)[u-u_h] \label{eq:falkdance} \\
  &= F(u)[u] + F(u_h)[u_h] - F(u)[u_h] - F(u_h)[u] \notag \\
  &\le F(u)[v] + \ell[u-v] + F(u_h)[v_h] + \ell[u_h-v_h] \notag \\
  &\qquad - F(u)[u_h] - F(u_h)[u] \notag \\
  &= F(u)[v-u_h] - \ell[v-u_h] + F(u_h)[v_h-u] - \ell[v_h-u] \notag \\
  &= \left(F(u)-\ell\right)[v-u_h] + \left(F(u)-\ell\right)[v_h-u] \notag \\
  &\qquad + \left(F(u)-F(u_h)\right)[u-v_h] \notag
\end{align}
Since $u,u_h\in B_{R_h} = \{w\in\cX\,:\,\|w\|\le R_h\}$, by the Lipschitz assumption \eqref{eq:lipschitz} there is $C(R_h)>0$ so that the last term from \eqref{eq:falkdance} has bound
\begin{equation}
\left(F(u)-F(u_h)\right)[u-v_h] \le C(R_h) \|u-u_h\|\|u-v_h\|. \label{eq:falklip}
\end{equation}
Now use Young's inequality with $\eps>0$ \cite[Appendix B.2]{Evans2010} on \eqref{eq:falklip}.  We have:
\begin{align}
\alpha \|u-u_h\|^q &\le \left(F(u)-\ell\right)[v-u_h] + \left(F(u)-\ell\right)[v_h-u]  \label{eq:falkyoung} \\
  &\qquad + C(R_h) \left(\eps\|u-u_h\|^q + \tilde C(\eps) \|u-v_h\|^{q'}\right) \notag
\end{align}
where $\tilde C(\eps) = (\eps q)^{-q'/q} {q'}^{-1}$.  Choose $\eps>0$ so that $C(R_h) \eps \le \alpha/2$.  Then
\begin{align}
\frac{\alpha}{2} \|u-u_h\|^q &\le \left(F(u)-\ell\right)[v-u_h] + \left(F(u)-\ell\right)[v_h-u]  \label{eq:falkalmost} \\
  &\qquad + C(R_h) \tilde C(\eps) \|u-v_h\|^{q'} \notag
\end{align}
Apply Lemma \ref{lem:measure} to \eqref{eq:falkalmost}, note $u=\psi$ a.e.~in $A_u$, and take infimums to show \eqref{eq:falk}.\end{proof}

Theorem \ref{thm:genfalk} can be extended to non-conforming operators $F_h\approx F$ by adding a fourth term ``$(F(u_h)-F_h(u_h))[u_h]$'' to the bound \cite[Theorem 6.3]{Bueler2024}.  However, we will not need this extended result.

In situation \emph{ii)} earlier, namely $\cK_h\subset \cK$, the first ``$\inf$'' term from \eqref{eq:falk} is zero.

\begin{corollary} \label{cor:falkconforming}
Suppose $\cK_h\subset \cK$, plus the other hypotheses of Theorem \ref{thm:genfalk}.  Then
\begin{equation} \label{eq:falkconforming}
\|u-u_h\|^q \le \frac{2}{\alpha} \left(\inf_{v_h\in\cK_h} \int_{A_u} (v_h-\psi)\,d\mu_u + c(R_h) \inf_{v_h\in\cK_h} \|v_h - u\|^{q'}\right).
\end{equation}
\end{corollary}

Furthermore, in the unconstrained PDE case, where $A_u=\emptyset$ and $d\mu_u=0$, the bound can be reduced to Cea's lemma for $q$-coercive operators, namely $\|u-u_h\| \lesssim \inf_{v_h\in\cK_h} \|v_h - u\|^{1/(q-1)}$.  In any case, as is standard in FE theory, $\inf_{v_h\in\cK_h} \|v_h - u\|$ can be addressed by a regularity theory for the exact solution $u$, plus interpolation theory \cite{AinsworthOden2000,ElmanSilvesterWathen2014}, yielding convergence \cite[Theorem 5.1.2]{Ciarlet2002}.

However, how should we interpret the $\cK_h$ infimum term in \eqref{eq:falk} and \eqref{eq:falkconforming}?:
	$$(\ast) \qquad \inf_{v_h\in\cK_h} \int_{A_u} (v_h-\psi)\,d\mu_u$$
This is unrelated to the FE solution $u_h$.  If $v_h < \psi$ is locally possible then $(\ast)$ might be negative, but then situation \emph{i)} holds and the ``$\inf_{v\in\cK}$'' term in \eqref{eq:falk} might counter-act (i.e.~if $v\ge \psi > u_h$ anywhere).  In the simpler situation \emph{ii)}, where $\psi_h\ge \psi$ and $\cK_h\subset \cK$, the term is at least nonnegative.  It might be large because no $v_h\in\cK_h$ is close to $\psi$ over $A_u$, for instance where $v_h\ge \psi_h \gg \psi$.  On the other hand, $(\ast)$ might be large even where $v_h-\psi$ can be made small over $A_u$, that is, if the source functional $\ell$ causes the residual $F(u)-\ell\ge 0$ to be large in $A_u$.  (Meaning: $d\mu_u(S)$ is positive and large for some measurable $S\subset A_u$.)  In summary, in the situation where $\cK_h\subset \cK$, the bound \eqref{eq:falkconforming} is significantly larger than that from Cea's lemma only when the FE functions $v_h$ are blocked by $\psi_h$ from descending close to the continuum obstacle $\psi$, or when the (exact) residual $d\mu_u$ is large in the (exact) active set $A_u$, or both.


\section{\emph{A posteriori} error estimation in inactive and active sets} \label{sec:aposteriori}

For $u\in\cX$ solving VI \eqref{eq:vi}, a PDE holds in the inactive set $I_u$, the so-called \emph{interior condition} \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}.  In Section \ref{sec:results} we will demonstrate strategies which primarily do (\emph{a posteriori}) refinement in the geometric vicinity of the free boundary, but we also exploit \emph{a posteriori} error indicators for the interior condition PDE.  We consider two indicators, the first of which is well-defined independent of that PDE.  It is based on \emph{gradient recovery} \cite[Chapter 4]{AinsworthOden2000}, and it is used in Section \ref{sec:app}.

\begin{example}  \label{example:gradrecovery}  Suppose $\cX_h$ is a continuous, piecewise-polynomial FE space, of degree $p$, and suppose $u_h\in\cX_h$.  Generally $\grad u_h$ is discontinuous, but it is well-defined on each element.  Let $\cY_h$ be the (scalar) discontinous space with polynomial degree $p-1$, so $\grad u_h \in \cY_h^d$.  Suppose there is a linear operator $G : \cY_h^d \to \cX_h^d$, which we call \emph{gradient recovery}, which is designed so that $G(u_h)\approx \grad u$ in $\cX^d$ in some sense, assuming of course that $u_h\approx u$ in $\cX$.  Then the error indicator $\eta_K\ge 0$ for this gradient recovery method, over an element $K \in\cT_h$, is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gradrecoveryindicator}
\eta_K^2 = \int_K \left|G(u_h) - \grad u_h\right|^2.
\end{equation}
\end{example}

Generally one applies the indicator to a solution $u_h \in \cK_h$ of \eqref{eq:fe:vi}, but observe that formula \eqref{eq:gradrecoveryindicator} is well-defined for any $u_h \in \cX_h$.  Let $\eta^2 = \sum_{K\in\cT_h} \eta_K^2$.  For certain gradient recovery methods $G$ it can be shown that, at least for the Poisson equation, $\eta \sim |u-u_h|_{H^1}$ (energy norm) asymptotically as $h\to 0$ \cite[Theorem 4.4]{AinsworthOden2000}.

In Sections \ref{sec:results} and \ref{sec:app} our gradient recovery operation will simply be orthogonal projection in $L^2$.  That is, $w = G(u_h) \in \cX_h^d$ is the minimizer of
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gradrecoveryprojection}
J(w) = \int_\Omega |w - \grad u_h|^2\,dx.
\end{equation}
In the results shown later, the space $\cX_h$ will be the continuous $P_1$ FE space, thus $\grad u_h$ is in (vector-valued) discontinuous $P_0$ space.  It is not clear to the current authors whether Theorem 4.4 in \cite{AinsworthOden2000} applies to our recovery operator.  (The operators analyzed by \cite{AinsworthOden2000} act by averaging element centroid values to get $\cX_h$ nodal values.)

The second indicator is only stated for the classical obstacle problem.  It is a well-known \emph{explicit error estimator} for the Poisson equation \cite[Chapter 2]{AinsworthOden2000}.

\begin{example}  \label{example:br}  Suppose $u \in H^1(\Omega)$ solves the weak form PDE $a(u,v) = \int_\Omega f v\,dx$ for all $v \in H^1_0(\Omega)$, with $u=g$ on $\partial \Omega$, for the bilinear form $a(u,v)=\int_\Omega \grad u\cdot \grad v\,dx$.  Suppose that $u_h$ from the continuous, $P_1$ FE space $\cX_h$ solves the corresponding finite-dimensional weak form.  For each element $K \in \cT_h$, define $n_K$ as the unit outward normal vector on $\partial K$.  For a pair of elements $L,K$ incident to an edge $\gamma$, and any vector field $Z$ with traces $Z_L,Z_K$ on $\gamma$, let $\left\llbracket Z \cdot n \right\rrbracket = Z_L \cdot n_L + Z_K \cdot n_K$ be the jump of $Z$ on $\gamma$.  Given the Poisson (strong) residual $r(v)=-\nabla^2 v - f$ defined within the elements, the Babu\v{s}ka--Rheinboldt (BR) \cite{BabuskaRheinboldt1979} error estimator is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:brestimator}
\eta_K^2 = h_K^2 \int_K |r(u_h)|^2\,dx + \frac{h_K}{2} \sum_{\gamma \in \partial K \setminus \partial \Omega} \int_{\gamma} \left\llbracket \grad u_h \cdot n \right\rrbracket^2\,dS,
\end{equation}
where $h_K$ is the diameter of $K$.  It can be shown \cite[Chapter 2]{AinsworthOden2000} that the energy error is bounded by the sum of these indicators:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:brbound}
|u-u_h|_{H^1}^2 = \int_\Omega |\grad(u-u_h)|^2\,dx \le C \eta^2,
\end{equation}
where $\eta^2 = \sum_{K\in\cT_h} \eta_K^2$.  The constant $C>0$ is determined by the element-wise and edge-wise approximation properties of the elements, including shape regularity.  The $L^2$ error can be bounded by a similar indicator (estimator) \cite[Section 2.4]{AinsworthOden2000}, which replaces the powers in \eqref{eq:brestimator} by $h_K^4,h_K^3$, respectively.
\end{example}

Whether $\eta_K$ is computed as in Example \ref{example:gradrecovery} or \ref{example:br}, we will treat these values as local element-wise error estimators.  That is, the set of values $\eta_K$ will be thresholded to providing tagging of elements for refinement; see \cite[Section 4.2]{BangerthRannacher2003} for discussion of such techniques.  Specifically, all (computed) inactive elements satisfying $\eta_K \ge \theta \max \eta_K$, for $0<\theta<1$, will be tagged and refined.  For more details see the next Section.

The BR error estimator in Example \ref{example:br}, for the Poisson equation, is explicit and easily-computed.  Ainsworth, Oden, and Lee \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993} extend this estimator to certain obstacle problems, but with heuristic aspects.

For PDE problems, an alternative to a local BR-type estimator is provided by the \emph{dual weighted residual} (DWR) technique \cite{BangerthRannacher2003}.  Such estimators are defined using a particular quantity of interest and nonlocal weights (approximately) computed from an adjoint problem.  The weights are essentially Green's functions of the adjoint PDE.  Suttmeier \cite{Suttmeier2008} has extended this DWR technique to VI problems, but this also requires heuristic steps even for the classical obstacle problem.  However, at least for obstacle problems with disconnected inactive sets---see Figure \ref{fig:activesizes} (right)---the weightings from a DWR technique are zero when a free boundary separates the components of the inactive set.  Even if the inactive set is connected, the weights in DWR would be very small in a problem like the one with a spiral active set (Figure \ref{fig:activesizes}, left); though the inactive set is connected it is geometrically very complicated.

In this paper we avoid the complexity of the techniques in references \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993} and \cite{Suttmeier2008}, and instead take a more pragmatic approach.  We apply fast (and again heuristic) refinement near a computed free boundary.  We combine this with application of a gradient-recovery or BR estimator, as above, within the computed inactive sets.

Returning to the general, continuum problem \eqref{eq:vi}, next we point out a qualitative property of certain unilateral obstacle problems, which can be exploited \emph{a posteriori} in the active set.  Note that for the classical obstacle problem \eqref{eq:classical:vi}, assuming a continuous source $f\in C(\bar\Omega)$ for simplicity, in general an upward force $f(x)>0$ can occur in the active set.  That is, the force, while locally upward, may be insufficient to lift $u$ above a concave $\psi$.  However, in certain obstacle problems this cannot occur.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:blister}
Suppose that $\psi=0$ and $\ell[v] = \int_\Omega fv\,dx$ for $f\in C(\bar\Omega)$.  Suppose also that $F$ is given by measurable densities, for example $F(w)[v]=\int_\Omega \phi(w(x),\grad w(x)) v(x) + \Phi(w(x),\grad w(x)) \cdot \grad v(x)\,dx$, satisfying $\phi(0,0)=0$ and $\Phi(0,0)=0$.  Then for $u$ solving \eqref{eq:vi}, $f\le 0$ a.e.~in $A_u$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $S\subset A_u$ be a Borel set, and denote its indicator function by $\chi_S \in L^\infty(\Omega)$.  The operator value $F(u)[\chi_S]$ is well-defined, \emph{and zero}, because $S$ is in the active set, by a density argument.  Thus by Lemma \ref{lem:measure},
\begin{equation*}
0 \le d\mu_u(S) = F(u)[\chi_S]-\ell[\chi_S] = 0 - \ell[\chi_S] = -\int_S f\,dx.
\end{equation*}
This shows $f\le 0$ a.e.~with respect to Lebesgue measure.
\end{proof}

The hypotheses of the Lemma clearly hold for problem \eqref{eq:classical:vi} if $\psi=0$.

By definition, we say that a unilateral obstacle problem, based on $\ell[v] = \int_\Omega fv\,dx$ with $f\in C(\bar \Omega)$, has the \emph{blistering property} if $A_u \subset \{x \in \Omega\, :\, f(x)\le 0\}$ \cite{JouvetBueler2012}, up to a set of measure zero, that is, if the conclusion of Lemma \ref{lem:blister} holds.  To explain the language, if $f(x)>0$ anywhere, for continuous $f$, then under this property the inactive set $I_u$ must be non-empty, and $x\in I_u$; even a small upward force ``blisters'' the membrane off the obstacle.  Note that porous-dam saturation free boundary problems, such as the examples in \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993}, have this property because $\psi=0$.

In fact, any classical problem \eqref{eq:classical:vi} with a smooth obstacle $\psi\in C^2(\bar\Omega)$ can be transformed into one with the blistering property.  To see this, make the obstacle zero by transforming $\tilde v=v-\psi$, thus $\tilde\cK = \{\tilde v\in\cX\,:\,\tilde v\ge 0 \text{ and } \tilde v|_{\partial\Omega}=g-\psi|_{\partial\Omega}\}$.  Integration-by-parts shows \eqref{eq:classical:vi} is equivalent to finding $\tilde u = u -\psi \in \tilde \cK$ so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:classical:vi:blister}
\int_\Omega \nabla \tilde u \cdot \nabla(\tilde v - \tilde u) \ge \int_\Omega \left(f+\grad^2\psi\right)(\tilde v - \tilde u) \quad \text{ for all } \tilde v \in \tilde \cK.
\end{equation}
For VI problem \eqref{eq:classical:vi:blister}, if $x\in A_{\tilde u} = \{\tilde u(x)=0\}$ then $\tilde f(x)= f(x)+\grad^2\psi(x)\le 0$.

For blistering-property problems, substantial AMR efficiency can be achieved by avoiding refinement in the computed active set $A_u^h$.  However, one must carefully identify those elements where no refinement would be beneficial.  Assume the blistering property, and consider an element $K\in \cT_h$ in the active set $A_u^h$.  (In our implementation, this means that \emph{every node in the closure of $K$} is active, according to a tolerance criterion.)  The degenerate case $f=0$ must first be excluded within $K$.  That is, one must know that $K$ is contained in the set $\Omega_- = \{x\in \Omega\,:\,f(x) < 0\}$, which is a property of the data of the problem.  If later refinements might move the free boundary to impinge on $K$ then refinement of $K$ would be appropriate, thus our techniques (next Section) will be designed to mark for refinement those active-set elements which are ``near'' $\Gamma_u^h$ in some sense.  However, if $f \le 0$ on $K$, and if $K$ is too far from the free boundary to be inactivated by later solutions along the refinement path, then $K$ can remain unrefined without affecting solution accuracy.


\section{New adaptive mesh refinement strategies} \label{sec:viamr}

Two of our new methods for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) for VIs are of \emph{tag-and-refine} type, and this section introduces those algorithms first.  In the context of PDEs, the tagging step uses a quantity of interest like energy or $L^2$ norm error, or a local functional \cite{BangerthRannacher2003}, to generate local error indicators $\eta_K$.  For the inactive set PDE (interior condition) of problem \eqref{eq:vi}, we have already discussed such indicators $\eta_K$ (Section \ref{sec:aposteriori}).  However, in this paper the primary quantity of interest for obstacle problems is \emph{vicinity to the unknown free boundary}.  To our knowledge there is no precise functional which computes this quantity, and so all of our method proceed heuristically to some degree.

\newcommand{\DGzero}{\text{DG}_0}

Our tag-and-refine methods are loops that start by computing a solution $u_h \in \cK_h$ to FE VI problem \eqref{eq:fe:vi} over the current mesh $\cT_h$.  Then they generate a piecewise-constant, i.e.~$\DGzero$, function $I_h$ from the current solution $u_h$.  This refinement indicator function $I_h$ has values in $\{0,1\}$, with one for elements which are to be refined.  Our work then uses either skeleton-based-refinement \cite{PlazaCarey2000} from the PETSc DMPlex component \cite{petsc-user-ref} or from the Netgen library \cite{Betteridgeetal2024}, to generate new meshes with no hanging nodes and quasi-uniformity \cite{BangerthRannacher2003}.  (We also compare to an alternative metric-based framework which allows refinement and coarsening \cite{Wallworketal2020}.)  Then the loop repeats until a desired resolution is achieved.

FIXME (Recall that interpolation into $\DGzero$ is simply the element-wise averaging of function values.)

The first strategy is called Variable Coefficient Diffusion (VCD). The idea is to use the residual $u^k - \psi$ and a positive tolerance to construct $s_0$, a node-wise indicator function for the active set. This indicator function is used as the initial condition of a variable-coefficient and time-dependent heat equation problem which has the effect of smoothing this indicator near the free boundary. This heat equation problem is solved for a single timestep via implicit Euler, the result of which, we'll call $s_1$. This problem is a linear elliptic PDE, hence "elliptic smoothing"
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{\Delta t}(s_1 - s_0) = \nabla^2 s_1.
\end{equation}
Our choice of timestep $\Delta t_i = \frac{1}{2}(\text{avg}(\text{diam}(\triangle_i)))^2$ where $\triangle_i$ is the set of all elements incident to vertex $i$. This choice depends on the element, thus "variable coefficient". Varying the timestep based off of neighboring element diameter has the effect of applying the same amount diffusion across all elements regardless of size. The result is then interpolated into a DG0 space and thresholded to produce the refinement indicator, as in Algorithim 2. There are various parameters to consider with this technique. The choice of timestep and thresholding parameters will substantially affect the "distance" about which the free boundary is resolved.

Support for unstructured meshes in Firedrake comes from the DMPlex class in PETSc, as developed by \cite{LangeKnepleyGorman2015}. DMPlex is a data management object which can store the topology (connectivity of mesh entities) and geometry (coordinates) of a discretization. In the DMPlex object every mesh entity is assigned a unique index. The connectivity of a mesh is stored as a layered directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which a "covering" relation specifies the edges of the graph. For example, for a tetrahedral element in a 3d mesh, a face is covered by 3 edges and a tetrahedral cell is covered by 4 faces. Each layer represents a class of mesh entity i.e vertices, edges, etc. Below is an example of how a single tetrahedral cell is represented by DMPlex.

The DMPlex object has several methods which make querying the mesh topology and geometry simple \citep{Langeetal2016}. For example, let $p$ be an index assigned by DMPlex. Then $\emph{cone}(p)$ returns all the in-neighbors of $p$. In the example above $\emph{cone}(0) = \{11, 12, 13, 14\}$. The transitive closure of $\emph{cone}(p)$ is also available with $\emph{closure}(p)$. The dual of $\emph{cone}(p)$ is $\emph{support}(p)$ which returns all the out-neighbors of $p$. In the example above $\emph{support}(6) = \{6, 7, 10\}$. The transitive closure of $\emph{support}(p)$ is also available with $\emph{star}(p)$. 

The use of DMPlex queries is essential to our second strategy, the Unstructured Dilation Operator (UDO). We identify the set $B$ of elements that border the computed free boundary $\Gamma_{u^k}$ by interpolating a nodal active indicator function into DG0 and thresholding for values in the range (0, 1). We then use the \emph{closure} and \emph{star} methods to create vertex-to-cell and cell-to-vertex mappings. These mappings are then used to determine which elements are neighbors to the computed free boundary. We say an element neighbors another if it shares at least one vertex. The function $N(\triangle)$ returns a set of elements:
\begin{equation}
  N(\triangle) = \{\triangle_i \in T: \triangle \text{ shares at least 1 vertex with } \triangle_i\}.
\end{equation}
This process is then repeated $n$ times to create a set of elements that are within $n$ neighborhood levels of the border elements:
\begin{equation}
  N^n(\triangle) = \underbrace{N(...N(\triangle))}_{n \text{ times}}.

As show in Algorithim 3, for a border element set $B$, defined below in (5.5) we use breadth-first search to construct the set $N^n(B)$ and then assemble its corresponding indicator function. This process expand the support of the DG0 indicator function in a way that resembles the "dilation" operation in image processing as seen in \citep{OpenCV} but it is applied over an unstructured mesh.

  \caption{Unstructured Dilation Operator Element Tagging for VIs}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Require $tol \in \mathbb{R}$, $u^k \in K, \psi \in V$, $W$ is a DGO FE space, mesh $T$.
    \Require Neighborhood Depth Parameter $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
    \State Compute the nodal active set indicator function $s$
    \begin{equation}
    s = \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{ if } u^k - \psi < tol\\
      0 & \text{ otherwise}
    \end{cases}.
    \end{equation}
  
    \State Let $s_W = interpolate(s, W)$ .
    \State Define the border element set $B$:
    \begin{equation}
    B = \{\triangle \in T: 0 < s_W(\triangle) < 1 \} .
    \end{equation}

    \State Use the \emph{closure} and \emph{star} methods to construct vertex-to-cell and cell-to-vertex mappings.

    \State Use breadth-first search to construct the set $N^n(B)$ as in (5.2) and (5.3). 
    \State Assemble the indicator function $I$ of the set $N^n(B)$. \\
    \Return $I$
  \end{algorithmic}
  \end{algorithm}

Using thresholding $u - \psi < 0.001$ to determine the active set, running this example generates the following Figure.

We end this section with a minimal Python example code, Figure \ref{fig:exampleAOL}.  This solves Example 1 from \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993}, a classical obstacle problem over a rectangle, with obstacle $\psi=0$ and a known exact solution, on a coarse mesh and then applies VCD marking and refinement.  The initial mesh, marked elements near the free boundary, and refined mesh are shown in Figure \ref{fig:resultAOL}.

\section{Application to determining glaciated areas} \label{sec:app}

In this section we apply the VCD method to a model for steady ice sheet geometry over a given bedrock topography and with a given climate (which determines the difference of snowfall rate minus summer melt).  The operator is fully nonlinear, and the problem is not of optimization type; an objective function does not exist when the bedrock is not flat.  Similar VI problems arise for any fluid layer subject to local surface processes which can add and remove mass \cite{Bueler2021b}.

Let $\Omega \subset \RR^2$ be a fixed region of land, and suppose $b \in C^1(\Omega)$ gives the bedrock elevation, in meters, on $\Omega$.  Let $a \in L^2(\Omega)$ denote a given surface mass-balance function \cite{GreveBlatter2009}, the annually-averaged rate of ice accumulation (snow) minus melt and runoff in meters per second.  Then the ice thickness $H$ of a steady-state glacier or ice sheet, also in meters, satisfies a VI problem over the set of admissible thicknesses, i.e.~with $H\ge 0$.

Specifically we consider a glacier flow approximation called the \emph{shallow ice approximation} \cite{GreveBlatter2009}, in the simplest isothermal and non-sliding case.   As shown in \cite{JouvetBueler2012}, with the standard exponent for the flow law of ice, this model is a VI for the transformed thickness $u=H^{8/3}$, similar to a $p$-Laplacian model, subject to the constraint $u\ge 0$.  Let $\cX = W^{1,4}(\Omega)$ and $\cK = \{u \in \cX\,:\,u\ge 0 \text{ and } u|_{\partial\Omega}=0\}$.  We seek $u\in\cK$ so that  FIXME CHECK DETAILS FROM \cite{JouvetBueler2012}
\begin{equation}
\int_\Omega \Gamma |\grad u - \Phi(u)|^2 (\grad u - \Phi(u)) \cdot \grad (v-u) \,dx \ge \int_\Omega a (v-u)\,dx \quad \text{ for all } v \in \cK. \label{eq:siavi}
\end{equation}
Here $\Gamma>0$ is a physical constant, essentially the ice softness.  The nonlinear operator here is
\begin{equation}
F(u)[v] = \Gamma |\grad u - \Phi(u)|^2 (\grad u - \Phi(u)) \cdot \grad v \,dx. \label{eq:siaoperator}
\end{equation}

Existence holds for \eqref{eq:siavi} \cite{JouvetBueler2012}, but uniqueness is open.  This theory, and also observations of ice sheets, shows that $|\grad H|$ is often unbounded as one approaches the free boundary from the icy side.

\section{Discussion and conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

FIXME \emph{Grid Sequencing + AMR targeting the free boundary} is the iterative process for how we are converging (heuristically at least) to the FB.  The bulk of vinewton iterations are coming from stabilizing the initial iterate's FB (i think) and thereafter Grid Sequencing is allowing us to make small adjustments as we refine.  A gif of the DG0 active set indicator on the sphere problem will show this, the initial iterate is completely above $\psi$ (or zero, then  projects pointwise to be feasible) then the first iteration captures the bulk of the active set, then small adjustments afterwards. On top of this the grid sequencing works best on hierarchal meshes, with metric method  the "grid sequencing" is being done through cross mesh interpolation.
