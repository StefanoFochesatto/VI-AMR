\begin{abstract}
Free-boundary problems posed as variational inequalities, including obstacle problems, appear in many scientific and engineering applications.  In their finite element (FE) solution, localization of the free boundary may be the goal, and the geometrical free boundary localization error often dominates the overall numerical error.  In this paper we implement, using the Firedrake FE library, new parallel adaptive mesh refinement strategies which generate accurate, high-resolution free boundaries.  We evaluate three approaches: \emph{(i)} a tag-and-refine method using an unstructured dilation operator, which computes discrete adjacency to the free boundary, \emph{(ii)} a tag-and-refine method based on variable-coefficient diffusion, which thresholds a diffused active-set indicator function, and \emph{(iii)} a metric-based method which averages an anisotropic, Hessian-derived Riemannian metric with an isotropic metric computed from the diffused indicator in \emph{(ii)}.  For \emph{(i)} and \emph{(ii)} we add classical \emph{a posteriori} error estimators within the computed inactive sets, which are necessary to attain convergence (and accurate free boundaries).  These methods are evaluated by norm error, and geometrical localization using Jaccard and Hausdorff distances, versus mesh complexity.  Applications include classical Laplacian obstacle problems and a shallow ice flow problem for predicting glaciation of a land surface.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The classical Laplacian obstacle problem \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980} finds the equilibrium vertical displacement $u$ of an elastic membrane over some domain $\Omega \subset \RR^d$.  The membrane, attached with displacement $g$ at the fixed boundary $\partial\Omega$, is subjected to an applied force $f$, but it is constrained to be above a given obstacle $\psi$.  The strong formulation here is a complementarity problem over $\Omega$:
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:classical:ncp}
\begin{align}
  -\nabla^2 u - f \geq 0 \label{eq:classical:ncp:a} \\
  u - \psi \geq 0\\
  (-\nabla^2u - f)(u - \psi) = 0 \label{eq:classical:ncp:c}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
From a solution of \eqref{eq:classical:ncp}, or rather of its weak form below, we may identify the inactive and active sets, and the free boundary:
\begin{equation}
  I_u = \{x \in \Omega \,:\, u(x) > \psi(x)\}, \quad A_u = \Omega \setminus I_u, \quad \Gamma_u = \Omega \cap \partial I_u. \label{eq:classical:sets}
\end{equation}

For the example shown in Figure \ref{fig:ball}, the obstacle $\psi$ is an upper hemisphere, the active set $A_u$ (white mesh) is a disc, and the free boundary $\Gamma_u$ is a circle.  Note that $u$ solves the Poisson equation $-\nabla^2u = f$ on $I_u$; this ``interior condition'' of the problem is the black mesh in the Figure.  While both Dirichlet ($u=\psi$) and Neumann ($\partial u/\partial n = \partial \psi/\partial n$) conditions apply along the unknown free boundary $\Gamma_u$, only Dirichlet conditions hold on $\partial\Omega$.  Another physical interpretation of problem \eqref{eq:classical:ncp} is that $u$ models the pressure, which cannot go below zero ($\psi=0$), in a porous dam \cite[for example]{AinsworthOdenLee1993}.

\end{figure}

As is well-known \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}, problem \eqref{eq:classical:ncp} has a weak formulation which is a variational inequality (VI) over a Sobolev space.  Let $\cX=H^1(\Omega)$ \cite{ElmanSilvesterWathen2014} and suppose $\psi \in \cX \cap C(\bar\Omega)$.  Let $g:\partial \Omega\to \RR$ be continuous, with $g\ge\psi|_{\partial \Omega}$, and define
\begin{equation} \label{eq:classical:admissible}
\cK = \{u \in \cX \,:\, u \ge \psi \text{ and } u|_{\partial \Omega} = g\}
\end{equation}
as the admissible subset, which is closed and convex in $\cX$.  For $f\in L^2(\Omega)$, the VI formulation of \eqref{eq:classical:ncp} finds $u\in \cK$ so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:classical:vi}
\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla(v - u) \ge \int_\Omega f(v - u) \quad \text{ for all } v \in \cK.
\end{equation}

In Section \ref{sec:vifem} we will recall and extend some of the theory of such VIs, and their finite element (FE) approximation.  We will generalize from elliptic bilinear forms like \eqref{eq:classical:vi} to coercive nonlinear operators over Banach spaces.  A conforming FE approximation $u_h$ of the VI will solve the same weak form, but over a finite-dimensional admissible set constructed on a mesh $\cT_h$.  Similarly to Cea's lemma for PDEs \cite{ElmanSilvesterWathen2014}, the norm errors $\|u-u_h\|$ can be bounded \emph{a priori} by extending the Falk \cite{Falk1974} technique to nonlinear operators, and results in Section \ref{sec:vifem} will show how norm errors are controlled by the approximation properties of the FE space, but also subject to VI-specific concerns regarding admissibility.  We will consider the construction of the FE obstacle and the separation of active and inactive set errors.

Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) uses \emph{a posteriori} information from the numerical solution to strategically add mesh elements to increase the resolution and reduce the numerical error.  For VI problems the simulation goal is often the accurate approximation of the sets in \eqref{eq:classical:sets}, but the reasonableness of this goal is problem-dependent.

\begin{example} \label{example:notcontinuous}  Suppose $\Omega = (-1,1)$, $\psi(x)=1 - x^2$, and $g(x)=0$, but let $f$ be a constant parameter: $f(x)=\alpha$.  The exact solution $u$ of \eqref{eq:classical:vi} for this data is easily calculated: $u(x)=\psi(x)$ if $\alpha\le 2$ and $u(x)=(\alpha/2)\psi(x)>\psi(x)$ if $\alpha>2$.  Thus for $\alpha \ge 2$ we have $A_u=\Omega$ and $I_u=\emptyset$, while $A_u=\emptyset$ and $I_u=\Omega$ if $\alpha<2$, so the sets \eqref{eq:classical:sets} are not continuous functions of the data $f$ of the problem.  This example can be easily modified to show that, likewise, the sets are not continuous functions of $\psi$ either.
\end{example}

The $\alpha=2$ case of Example \ref{example:notcontinuous} is \emph{degenerate} \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}, that is, the unconstrained solution happens to match the obstacle on a nonempty open set.  Clearly any predictable convergence results for FE approximations of the solution-dependent sets $A_u,I_u,\Gamma_u$ will depend upon problem nondegeneracy, and our examples are accordingly non-degenerate.

Furthermore, the effectiveness of different AMR strategies for non-degenerate VI problems depends strongly upon the measure (area or volume) of the active and inactive sets.  This observation motivates the \emph{a posteriori} approaches of this paper.  For example, in certain problems the elements which are significantly interior to the active set require no further computation or refinement.  For such problems, for which examples are given in Sections \ref{sec:results} and \ref{sec:app}, if a solution is desired at higher resolution within the active set, i.e.~where $u=\psi$, then this can be computed in post-processing by arbitrary interpolation of the obstacle data; refinement effort in the active set and during the solution process is wasted.

\begin{example} \label{example:activesets} Examples in Section \ref{sec:results} will measure convergence rates for three 2D classical obstacle problems.  Figure \ref{fig:activesizes} shows high-resolution active sets, in black, for these examples.  For the right-most case, with a large active set, we will see that most of the performance benefit of our preferred AMR techniques, relative to uniform refinement, comes from avoiding refinement in the active set.  The glaciation application in Section \ref{sec:app} can also exploit this situation. \end{example}

\end{figure}

In this work we consider only $P_1$ element spaces over meshs of triangles or tetrahedra, and only $h$-refinement is addressed.  VIs can be solved using $p$-refinement and higher-order elements, but only if nontrivial monotonicity modifications are made \cite{KeithSurowiec2024}, which is not attempted here.  Furthermore, while the classical obstacle problem \eqref{eq:classical:vi} is equivalent to constrained minimization of a scalar objective, our analysis of FE errors for VI problems does not require an objective, and our AMR strategies do not need, nor can they exploit, an objective.

Three AMR methods for VIs are described in Section \ref{sec:viamr}.  Our implementations use the Firedrake FE library \cite{Rathgeberetal2016} and produce conforming meshes with no hanging nodes.  The first two methods are of tag-and-refine type, only differing by which elements are tagged, with skeleton-based refinement (SBR) \cite{PlazaCarey2000} applied after tagging; SBR is implemented within PETSc's DMPlex component \cite{petsc-user-ref} and in the Netgen library \cite{Betteridgeetal2024}.  These two methods also require a complementary AMR approach to the PDE problem in the inactive set to achieve convergence; see Section \ref{sec:inactive}.  The third goal-oriented and metric-based method uses the Netgen and Animate (\href{https://github.com/mesh-adaptation/animate}{{\small \texttt{github.com/mesh-adaptation/animate}}}; see also \cite{Wallworketal2020}) libraries for metric-based mesh adaptation.  Full details are given in Section \ref{sec:viamr}, but here is a high-level view of the methods:

%\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\emph{\roman{enumi})}}
\begin{itemize}
\item[UDO:] The unstructured dilation operator method discretely identifies elements adjacent to the computed free boundary, employing a graph-based approach to tag neighboring elements for refinement.  It generalizes the image processing operation of dilation \cite{Pratt1991} to unstructured meshes.
\item[VCD:] The variable-coefficient diffusion method starts from a node-wise indicator function for the current computed active set.  This indicator becomes the initial iterate in a single step of a time-dependent heat equation problem, which smooths the indicator about the free boundary.  The smoothed indicator is then thresholded for element tagging.
\item[AVM:] The averaged-metric method computes an intermediate representation of the size, shape, and orientation of the new mesh, as a tensor-valued Riemannian metric \cite{Alauzet2010}.  The metric is an average of an anisotropic metric, from the Hessian of the computed solution \cite{Wallworketal2020}, and an isotropic metric, from the diffused active set indicator of the VCD method.  This method approximately maintains mesh complexity, and it adjusts both inactive and active set meshes simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

Example meshes are shown in Figure \ref{fig:threeballmeshes}.  They were generated by 3 levels of refinement using the above three methods, starting from a coarse uniform mesh, on the obstacle problem shown in Figures \ref{fig:ball} and \ref{fig:activesizes} (middle).  These AMR methods increase the resolution both near the free boundary and in the inactive set.

\end{figure}

Our numerical results in Sections \ref{sec:results} and \ref{sec:app} will justify the somewhat-heuristic nature of these approaches to AMR for VIs.  Because the convergence of VI problems is dominated by the error in approximating the free boundary, an AMR scheme that quickly concentrates effort around an accurately-computed free boundary, augmented by PDE-type error estimators in the inactive set (Section \ref{sec:inactive}), will accelerate convergence and reduce unnecessary computation.

AMR for VI problems has been lightly explored in the literature.  The first published analysis may be \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993}, giving an error bound for the classical obstacle problem in terms of local functionals associated with each element.  The monograph by Suttmeier \cite{Suttmeier2008} covers a broader class of problems, including elasticity.  For the classical obstacle problem, the constructable error estimators in these works require heuristic assumptions which may not hold in general.  (See inequality (42) in \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993}, and the approximation ``$(u-\psi)\lambda_h\approx 0$'' in \cite{Suttmeier2008}.)  To our knowledge these approaches are not found in publicly-available implementations, nor are they as efficient as our strategies for computing high-resolution approximations to free boundaries.

Our focus in this paper is on AMR performance, not solver performance.  We use a fixed, VI-adapted, reduced-space Newton method with line search \cite{BensonMunson2006}, implemented in PETSc \cite{petsc-user-ref}, for all examples.  (Since the constraint $u \geq \psi$ makes VI problems nonlinear, an iterative solver like Newton is required even if the operator is linear.)  Such a numerical method cannot converge quadratically until the active and inactive sets stabilize on the given mesh, equivalently once the discrete free boundary is identified.  Then convergence can occur in one additional iteration, for a linear operator, or otherwise in a few iterations for well-behaved nonlinear operators.

In summary, here are two principles for the AMR methods of this paper:
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\arabic{enumi}.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Relative to uniform refinement, the methods exhibit significant improvements in convergence rate.  This is measured by norm or free-boundary localization (geometrical) error per mesh degree of freedom.
\item Their implementations (\href{https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/VI-AMR}{{\small \texttt{github.com/StefanoFochesatto/VI-AMR}}}), within the popular Firedrake \cite{Langeetal2016} FE library, are parallel, well-documented, and easy-to-use.
\end{enumerate}

The paper is organized as follows:  Section \ref{sec:vifem} provides \emph{a priori} norm bounds for FE methods applied to VI problems; aspects of this material are new.  Section \ref{sec:inactive} addresses \emph{a posteriori} error estimators which can be applied in the inactive set, and it identifies problems where active-set refinement can be avoided.  Section \ref{sec:viamr} describes the three new AMR methods in more detail.  Sections \ref{sec:results} and \ref{sec:app} compare and discuss their performance on model problems and a realistic glacier application.

\section{Variational inequalities and their finite element approximations} \label{sec:vifem}

We consider unilateral obstacle problems in Banach spaces.  Let $\Omega \subset \RR^d$, $d=2,3$, be a bounded, polygonal domain.  Let $\cX = W^{1,p}(\Omega)$, $p>1$, be the Sobolev space of measurable functions with $p$th-integrable weak gradients \cite{Evans2010}.  We will assume continuous problem data, with well-defined point values, so suppose $\psi \in \cX \cap C(\bar\Omega)$ and $g\in C(\partial \Omega)$ satisfy $g \ge \psi|_{\partial\Omega}$.  Define the closed and convex admissible subset
\begin{equation} \label{eq:admissible}
\cK = \{v \in \cX \,:\, v \ge \psi \text{ and } v|_{\partial \Omega} = g\} \subset \cX,
\end{equation}
as in \eqref{eq:classical:admissible}.  Observe that generally $\psi\notin\cK$.

Let $\cX'$ be the dual space of $\cX$, and denote the application of $\omega \in \cX'$ to $v\in \cX$ by $\omega[v] \in \RR$.  The norm on $\cX$ is denoted $\|\cdot\|$, and for $\cX'$ the norm is $\|\omega\|' = \sup_{\|v\|=1} |\omega[v]|$.  Let $F:\cK \to \cX'$ be a given operator, generally nonlinear, and let $\ell\in \cX'$ be given.  While $F$ in Example \ref{example:classicalobstacle} is defined on all of $\cX$, the general operator $F$ might be only defined on $\cK$; Section \ref{sec:app} gives an example.  The VI associated to this data, a unilateral obstacle problem, is to find $u\in \cK$ so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:vi}
F(u)[v - u] \ge \ell[v - u] \quad \text{ for all } v \in \cK.
\end{equation}

The VI problems in this paper can be analyzed within the framework of coercivity and Lipschitz continuity.  We say $F$ is $q$-coercive, $1<q<\infty$, if there is $\alpha>0$ so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:coercive}
(F(v) - F(w))[v - w] \ge \alpha \|v-w\|^q
\end{equation}
for all $v,w \in \cK$.  Note that if $F$ is $q$-coercive then it is also strictly monotone: $(F(v) - F(w))[v - w] > 0$ for $v\ne w$.  Let $B_R(0)$ be the origin-centered open ball in $\cX$ of radius $R>0$.  We say $F$ is Lipschitz on bounded subsets if there is $C(R)>0$ so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lipschitz}
\|F(v)-F(w)\|' \le C(R) \|v-w\|
\end{equation}
for all $v,w \in B_R(0)\cap \cK$.  If $F$ satisfies \eqref{eq:lipschitz} then it is continuous.  From coercivity, strict monotonicity, and continuity of $F$ it follows that a unique solution to \eqref{eq:vi} exists \cite[Corollary III.1.8]{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}.

\begin{example}  \label{example:classicalobstacle}
In the classical obstacle problem \eqref{eq:classical:vi}, over $\cX=H^1(\Omega)=W^{1,2}(\Omega)$, $F(u)[v] = \int_\Omega \grad u\cdot \grad v\,dx$.  This bilinear operator is $2$-coercive because the Laplacian is uniformly elliptic \cite{Evans2010}, and it is Lipschitz over $\cX$ with constant $C=1$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}  \label{example:flatsia}
In glacier model of Section \ref{sec:app}, in the case where the bedrock is flat and the surface mass balance is independent of elevation, the VI problem \eqref{eq:siavi} uses a $4$-Laplacian operator over transformed thicknesses $u\in\cX=W^{1,4}(\Omega)$, namely $F(u)[v] = \int_\Omega \Gamma |\grad u|^2\grad u\cdot \grad v\,dx$ where $\Gamma>0$ is constant.  This operator is $4$-coercive \cite[for example]{JouvetBueler2012}, and it is Lipschitz on bounded subsets of $\cX$.  For more details see Section \ref{sec:app}.
\end{example}

Note that if the inequality constraint in \eqref{eq:vi} were absent then the residual of the solution $u$ would be zero almost everywhere ($F(u)-\ell=0$); this is the PDE case.  However, for VI \eqref{eq:vi} we only have that $F(u)-\ell=0$ a.e.~within the unknown inactive set $I_u$.  In fact, the residual $F(u)-\ell\in \cX'$ might be highly-irregular in the active set $A_u$, though it is at least nonnegative.  The following lemma states the weak complementarity property associated to VI \eqref{eq:vi}; compare strong-form complementarity \eqref{eq:classical:ncp} for \eqref{eq:classical:vi}.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:measure}\cite[Theorem II.6.9]{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}.  Suppose $u\in \cK$ solves \eqref{eq:vi}.  Then $F(u)-\ell=d\mu_u$ is a positive Radon measure supported in the active set $A_u$.  Thus for $w\in\cX$ we have
\begin{equation}
(F(u)-\ell)[w] = \int_{A_u} w\, d\mu_u. \label{eq:measure}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

Now let $\cT_h$ be a shape-regular mesh partition (triangulation, etc.) of $\Omega$ \cite{AinsworthOden2000,ElmanSilvesterWathen2014}.  Let $\cX_h \subset \cX \cap C(\bar\Omega)$ be a conforming finite-dimensional FE subspace over $\cT_h$.  Our examples will be piecewise-linear over triangles and tetrahedra: $\cX_h=P_1$.  Assume that there is $g_h\in\cX_h$ such that $g_h=g$ along $\partial \Omega$.  Let $\psi_h \in \cX_h$ be the FE obstacle, which satisfies the compatibility requirement $\psi_h \le g_h$ along $\partial\Omega$; for the moment, no other requirement relates $\psi_h$ to $\psi$.  Define the (nonempty) FE admissible set
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fe:admissible}
\cK_h = \{v_h \in \cX_h \,:\, v_h \ge \psi_h \text{ and } v_h|_{\partial \Omega} = g_h|_{\partial\Omega}\}.
\end{equation}
Our FE method seeks $u_h\in\cK_h$ satisfying the VI problem which approximates \eqref{eq:vi}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fe:vi}
F(u_h)[v_h - u_h] \ge \ell[v_h - u_h] \quad \text{ for all } v_h \in \cK_h.
\end{equation}
The same argument given for \eqref{eq:vi} shows that this has a unique solution $u_h$.  Define
\begin{equation}
  I_u^h = \{x \in \Omega \,:\, u_h(x) > \psi_h(x)\}, \quad A_u^h = \Omega \setminus I_u^h, \quad \Gamma_u^h = \Omega \cap \partial I_u^h, \label{eq:fe:sets}
\end{equation}
the numerical sets, corresponding to \eqref{eq:classical:sets}, here defined \emph{a posteriori} from solving \eqref{eq:fe:vi}.

Because $\cK_h \subset \cX_h \subset \cX$, we might regard \eqref{eq:fe:vi} as a conforming FE method for \eqref{eq:vi}.  However, this is subtle for an obstacle problem as it depends on the relationship between $\psi$ and $\psi_h$.  If $\psi_h$ is an interpolant of $\psi$, $\psi_h = \Pi_h \psi$, then $\cK_h \approx \cK$ in some sense, but one might distinguish three levels of increasingly ``conforming'' admissibility:
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\emph{\roman{enumi})}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\cK_h \not \subset \cK$
\item $\cK_h \subset \cK$
\item $\cK_h = \cK \cap \cX_h$
\end{enumerate}
Ciarlet \cite[Figure 5.1.3]{Ciarlet2002} observes that situation \emph{i)} generally applies for an interpolated obstacle $\psi_h = \Pi_h \psi$, e.g.~for $\cX_h=P_1$ and when $\psi$ is not convex.  Situation \emph{ii)} holds when $\psi_h \ge \psi$, which can be imposed by using a monotone injection operator, e.g.~``$\psi_h = R^\oplus \psi$'' in the notation from \cite{BuelerFarrell2024}.  (For related ideas, see \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} and the proof of Theorem 5.1.2 in \cite{Ciarlet2002}.)  The strongest condition \emph{iii)} holds if $\psi_h=\psi$ exactly, for example when $\psi=0$ in the porous dam problems considered by \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993}.

In any case, the obstacle $\psi$ is given \emph{as data} for VI problem \eqref{eq:vi} over $\cK$.  Point values of $\psi$ can be evaluated as desired to better-represent $u_h$ within the numerical active set $A_u^h$.  That is, over elements where there is active-set correctness, i.e.~$K\in\cT_h$ such that $K \subset A_u \cap A_u^h$, reducing the error $e=u-u_h=\psi-u_h$ can be done in post-processing, simply by improving the data representation $\psi_h \approx \psi$.  As the goal for a refined mesh is to more-accurately re-solve the FE problem, locating the free boundary and reducing $|e|$ in the inactive set, thus refinement within a stabilized active set is wasted effort.

These ideas can be seen in certain \emph{a priori} bounds for FE error in VI problems.  The following theorem generalizes the Falk bound \cite{Falk1974}; see also \cite[Theorem 5.1.1]{Ciarlet2002}.  It can be extended further to address $F_h\approx F$ \cite[Theorem 6.3]{Bueler2024}, but we will not need such an operator approximation for our examples.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:genfalk}  For $1<q<\infty$, define the conjugate exponent $q'=q/(q-1)$.  Assume that $F$ is $q$-coercive and Lipschitz on bounded subsets of its domain.  Suppose $u\in\cK$ solves \eqref{eq:vi} and $u_h\in\cK_h$ solves \eqref{eq:fe:vi}.  Let $R_h=\max\{\|u\|,\|u_h\|\}$.  Then there is a constant $c(R_h)>0$, not otherwise depending on $u$ or $u_h$, so that
\begin{align}
\|u-u_h\|^q &\le \frac{2}{\alpha} \bigg( \inf_{v\in\cK} \int_{A_u} (v-u_h)\,d\mu_u + \inf_{v_h\in\cK_h} \int_{A_u} (v_h-\psi)\,d\mu_u  \label{eq:falk} \\
   &\qquad\quad + c(R_h) \inf_{v_h\in\cK_h} \|v_h - u\|^{q'}\bigg). \notag
\end{align}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}  For arbitrary $v\in\cK$ and $v_h\in\cK_h$, rewrite \eqref{eq:vi} and \eqref{eq:fe:vi} as $F(u)[u] \le F(u)[v] + \ell[u-v]$ and $F(u_h)[u_h] \le F(u_h)[v_h] + \ell[u_h-v_h]$, respectively.  It follows from these inequalities, and $q$-coercivity of $F$, that
\begin{align}
\alpha \|u-u_h\|^q &\le \left(F(u)-F(u_h)\right)[u-u_h] \label{eq:falkdance} \\
  &= F(u)[u] + F(u_h)[u_h] - F(u)[u_h] - F(u_h)[u] \notag \\
  &\le F(u)[v] + \ell[u-v] + F(u_h)[v_h] + \ell[u_h-v_h] \notag \\
  &\qquad - F(u)[u_h] - F(u_h)[u] \notag \\
  &= F(u)[v-u_h] - \ell[v-u_h] + F(u_h)[v_h-u] - \ell[v_h-u] \notag \\
  &= \left(F(u)-\ell\right)[v-u_h] + \left(F(u)-\ell\right)[v_h-u] \notag \\
  &\qquad + \left(F(u)-F(u_h)\right)[u-v_h] \notag
\end{align}
Since $u,u_h\in B_{R_h} = \{w\in\cX\,:\,\|w\|\le R_h\}$, by the Lipschitz assumption \eqref{eq:lipschitz} there is $C(R_h)>0$ so that the last term from \eqref{eq:falkdance} has bound
\begin{equation}
\left(F(u)-F(u_h)\right)[u-v_h] \le C(R_h) \|u-u_h\|\|u-v_h\|. \label{eq:falklip}
\end{equation}
Now use Young's inequality with $\eps>0$ \cite[Appendix B.2]{Evans2010} on \eqref{eq:falklip}.  We have:
\begin{align}
\alpha \|u-u_h\|^q &\le \left(F(u)-\ell\right)[v-u_h] + \left(F(u)-\ell\right)[v_h-u]  \label{eq:falkyoung} \\
  &\qquad + C(R_h) \left(\eps\|u-u_h\|^q + \tilde C(\eps) \|u-v_h\|^{q'}\right) \notag
\end{align}
where $\tilde C(\eps) = (\eps q)^{-q'/q} {q'}^{-1}$.  Choose $\eps>0$ so that $C(R_h) \eps \le \alpha/2$.  Then
\begin{align}
\frac{\alpha}{2} \|u-u_h\|^q &\le \left(F(u)-\ell\right)[v-u_h] + \left(F(u)-\ell\right)[v_h-u]  \label{eq:falkalmost} \\
  &\qquad + C(R_h) \tilde C(\eps) \|u-v_h\|^{q'} \notag
\end{align}
Apply Lemma \ref{lem:measure} to \eqref{eq:falkalmost}, note $u=\psi$ a.e.~in $A_u$, and take infimums to show \eqref{eq:falk}.\end{proof}

Consider the unconstrained PDE case of \eqref{eq:falk}, namely with $A_u=\emptyset$ and $d\mu_u=0$.  In this case the bound is simply Cea's lemma for $q$-coercive operators, namely $\|u-u_h\| \lesssim \inf_{v_h\in\cK_h} \|v_h - u\|^{1/(q-1)}$.  It is standard in FE theory \cite{AinsworthOden2000,ElmanSilvesterWathen2014} to address this final term by solution regularity and interpolation theory.

If $\psi_h\ge \psi$ then $\cK_h\subset \cK$, and so the first term on the right of \eqref{eq:falk} is zero.  In this case bound \eqref{eq:falk} adds a nonnegative infimum, of an integral over $A_u$, to the $\|v_h-u\|$ term expected from Cea's lemma.  The addition is large if $v_h\in\cK_h$ is significantly blocked by $\psi_h$ from descending close to the continuum obstacle $\psi$ in the active set $A_u$, and/or if the residual measure $d\mu_u$ is large in $A_u$.

The \emph{a priori} error bound from Theorem \ref{thm:genfalk} becomes clearer in the $p=2$ and $q=q'=2$ case, i.e.~for the classical obstacle problem.  The bound can then be split between integrals over the (exact) active set and inactive sets.

\begin{corollary} \label{cor:falktwo}
Suppose all the hypotheses of Theorem \ref{thm:genfalk}.  Assume that $p=q=2$, and that $\psi \in C^1(\Omega)$.  Up to constants which depend on $u$ and $u_h$, we may write the \emph{a priori} bound with four integrals,
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:falktwo}
\begin{align}
\|u-u_h\|^2 \lesssim &\inf_{v\in\cK} \int_{A_u} (v-u_h)\,d\mu_u \label{eq:falktwo:a} \\
&\, + \inf_{v_h\in\cK_h} \int_{A_u} (v_h-\psi)\,d\mu_u \label{eq:falktwo:b} \\
&\, + \inf_{v_h\in\cK_h} \left(\int_{A_u} |\grad v_h - \grad \psi|^2\,dx + \int_{I_u} |\grad v_h - \grad u|^2\,dx\right) \label{eq:falktwo:c}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Apply Poincare's inequality to the final term in \eqref{eq:falk}.
\end{proof}

We now consider Corollary \ref{cor:falktwo} from the point of view of AMR.  The first term \eqref{eq:falktwo:a}, which can be of either sign, is controlled by the choice of $\psi_h$.  Since we are assuming $\cX_h\subset \cX$, this term relates only to discrete admissibility.  This term can be replaced by zero if $\cK_h \subset \cK$.  The second term \eqref{eq:falktwo:b}, also generally of either sign, relates both to discrete admissibility and to the approximation of $\psi$ using functions from $\cX_h$.  It is nonnegative if $\psi_h\ge \psi$.

Both integrals \eqref{eq:falktwo:a} and \eqref{eq:falktwo:b} are with respect to the residual measure $d\mu_u$, so their size is determined partly by the action of $F$ on the continuum obstacle, and partly by the source term $\ell$.  However, because they are over the active set $A_u$, neither integral \eqref{eq:falktwo:a} nor \eqref{eq:falktwo:b}, nor the $A_u$ integral in \eqref{eq:falktwo:c}, requires mesh refinement so as to improve the quality of the FE solution, \emph{as long as the mesh and solver accurately locate the free boundary}.  Corollary \ref{cor:falktwo} suggests why a primary goal of AMR for VIs is to use refinement to generate close approximation $\Gamma_u^h\approx \Gamma_u$.  Then the computational costs expended on better approximation of the data $\psi$ in $A_u$, during the solution process, can be avoided.

These observations are easiest to exploit within the class of unilateral obstacle problems described in Appendix \ref{app:blistering}, a class which includes the $\psi=0$ case of the classical obstacle problem \eqref{eq:classical:vi} and the glacier problem of Section \ref{sec:app}.  In such problems one may preprocess the data, marking all the areas where the source term is negative, and then systematically avoid unnecessary active set refinement.

In order for $\Gamma_u^h\approx \Gamma_u$ to be an accurate approximation, the interior condition of the VI, over $I_u$, must be accurately solved, which of course gives the significance of the final integral in \eqref{eq:falktwo:c}.  Our AMR approaches will simultaneously refine near the computed free boundary $\Gamma_u^h$ and in the (computed) inactive set $I_u^h$.


\section{\emph{A posteriori} error estimation in the inactive set} \label{sec:inactive}

For $u\in\cX$ solving VI \eqref{eq:vi}, an interior condition PDE holds in the inactive set $I_u$ \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}.  Our AMR strategies do \emph{a posteriori} refinement in the geometric vicinity of the free boundary, but they also exploit \emph{a posteriori} error indicators for this interior condition.  We consider two such PDE indicators.

\begin{example}  \label{example:gradrecovery}  Suppose $\cX_h=\CG_k$ is the continuous, piecewise-polynomial FE space of degree $k$, and consider $u_h\in\cX_h$.  Generally $\grad u_h$ is discontinuous but well-defined on each element.  If $\cY_h=\DG_{k-1}$ denotes the (scalar) discontinuous space with polynomial degree $k-1$ then $\grad u_h \in \cY_h^d$.  Suppose there is a linear operator $G : \cX_h \to \cX_h^d$, called \emph{gradient recovery} (GR) \citep[Chapter 4]{AinsworthOden2000}, so that $G(u_h)\approx \grad u$ in some sense, assuming of course that $u_h\approx u$ in $\cX$.  Then, over an element $K \in\cT_h$, the error indicator $\eta_K\ge 0$ for this GR method is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gradrecoveryindicator}
\eta_K^2 = \int_K \left|G(u_h) - \grad u_h\right|^2.
\end{equation}
We also define $\eta^2 = \sum_{K\in\cT_h} \eta_K^2$.
\end{example}

Generally one applies the indicator to a solution $u_h \in \cK_h$ of \eqref{eq:fe:vi}, but formula \eqref{eq:gradrecoveryindicator} is well-defined for any $u_h \in \cX_h$.  For certain gradient recovery methods $G$ applied to the Poisson equation, $\eta \sim |u-u_h|_{H^1}$ (energy norm) as $h\to 0$ \cite[Theorem 4.4]{AinsworthOden2000}.

Our application of GR in Section \ref{sec:app} will simply use orthogonal projection in $L^2$.  That is, $w = G(u_h) \in \cX_h^d$ is defined to be the minimizer of
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gradrecoveryprojection}
J(w) = \int_\Omega |w - \grad u_h|^2\,dx.
\end{equation}
In this application $\cX_h = \CG_1$, thus $\grad u_h$ is in (vector-valued) $\DG_0$.

The second indicator, applied in Section \ref{sec:results} to the Poisson equation interior condition of classical problem \eqref{eq:classical:vi}, is a well-known \emph{explicit error estimator} \cite[Chapter 2]{AinsworthOden2000}.

\begin{example}  \label{example:br}  Suppose $u \in H^1(\Omega)$ solves the weak form Poisson equation $a(u,v) = \int_\Omega f v\,dx$ for all $v \in H^1_0(\Omega)$, with $u=g$ on $\partial \Omega$, for $a(u,v)=\int_\Omega \grad u\cdot \grad v\,dx$.  Suppose that $u_h\in\cX_h=\CG_1$ solves the corresponding finite-dimensional weak form.  For each element $K \in \cT_h$, define $n_K$ as the unit outward normal vector on $\partial K$.  For a pair of elements $L,K$ incident to an edge $\gamma$, and any vector field $Z$ with traces $Z_L,Z_K$ on $\gamma$, let $\left\llbracket Z \cdot n \right\rrbracket = Z_L \cdot n_L + Z_K \cdot n_K$ be the jump of $Z$ on $\gamma$.  Given the (strong) residual $r(u_h)=-\nabla^2 u_h - f$ of the Poisson equation, well-defined within an element $K$, the Babu\v{s}ka--Rheinboldt (BR) \cite{BabuskaRheinboldt1979} error estimator is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:brestimator}
\eta_K^2 = h_K^2 \int_K |r(u_h)|^2\,dx + \frac{h_K}{2} \sum_{\gamma \in \partial K \setminus \partial \Omega} \int_{\gamma} \left\llbracket \grad u_h \cdot n \right\rrbracket^2\,dS,
\end{equation}
where $h_K$ is the diameter of $K$.  It can be shown \cite[Chapter 2]{AinsworthOden2000} that the energy error is bounded by $\eta^2 = \sum_{K\in\cT_h} \eta_K^2$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:brbound}
|u-u_h|_{H^1}^2 = \int_\Omega |\grad(u-u_h)|^2\,dx \le C \eta^2.
\end{equation}
Similarly the $L^2$ error can be bounded by an estimator, one which replaces the powers in \eqref{eq:brestimator} by $h_K^4,h_K^3$, respectively \cite[Section 2.4]{AinsworthOden2000}.
\end{example}

Whether $\eta_K$ is computed as in Example \ref{example:gradrecovery} or \ref{example:br}, we will treat these values as local element-wise error estimators.  The set $\{\eta_K\}$ will be thresholded to providing tagging of elements for refinement; see \cite[Section 4.2]{BangerthRannacher2003} for discussion of such techniques.  In one strategy, all (computed) inactive elements satisfying $\eta_K \ge \theta \max \eta_K$, for $0<\theta<1$, will be tagged and refined; see Section \ref{sec:results}.

The BR error estimator is explicit and easily-computed.  Ainsworth, Oden, and Lee \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993} extend it to certain obstacle problems, but with heuristic aspects.  On the other hand, for certain PDE problems, alternative estimators are provided by the \emph{dual weighted residual} (DWR) technique \cite{BangerthRannacher2003}.  These are defined using a particular quantity of interest and some approximately-computed nonlocal weights, essentially Green's functions of the adjoint PDE.  Suttmeier \cite{Suttmeier2008} has extended this DWR technique to certain VI problems, but this also requires heuristic steps even for the classical obstacle problem.  In this paper we avoid the complexity of the techniques in \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993} and \cite{Suttmeier2008}, and instead take a more pragmatic approach.  We propose fast, and again heuristic, refinement near a computed free boundary, combined with application of a gradient-recovery or BR estimator within the computed inactive sets.


\section{New adaptive mesh refinement strategies} \label{sec:viamr}

Our first two methods for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) for VIs, Algorithms \ref{alg:udo} and \ref{alg:vcd}, are of \emph{tag-and-refine} type.  A third, more-expensive \emph{metric-based mesh adaptation} approach \cite{Wallworketal2020} follows, namely Algorithm \ref{alg:avm} which can hold the mesh complexity approximately constant.

These methods start from a computed solution to FE VI problem \eqref{eq:fe:vi}.  We need only the mesh $\cT_h$, the obstacle $\psi_h \in \cX_h$, and the admissible solution $u_h \in \cK_h \subset \cX_h$.  The following two concepts are fundamental.

\begin{definition} \label{def:nodalactive}
Denote the vertices of $\cT_h$ by $x_j$.  Given $u_h \ge \psi_h$ and a tolerance $\text{tol}>0$, the \emph{nodal active set indicator} is the unique $\nu_h\in\cX_h$ satisfying
	$$\nu_h(x_j) = \begin{cases} 1, & u_h(x_j) - \psi_h(x_j) < \text{tol} \\
	                             0, & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$
for the nodes $x_j$ of $\cX_h$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} \label{def:marking}
An \emph{element marking} of $\cT_h$ is a piecewise-constant indicator function $I_h \in \DG_0(\cT_h)$ with values in $\{0,1\}$.  Elements such that $I_h|_K=1$ will be refined.
\end{definition}

For PDE problems, an element marking is typically derived from an error estimator $\eta_K$ associated with a quantity of interest, such as energy or $L^2$ norm error, or a local functional \cite{BangerthRannacher2003}; we gave examples in Section \ref{sec:inactive}.  However, a primary quantity of interest for obstacle problems is \emph{vicinity to the unknown free boundary}.  We do not associate this concept with a precise functional.  Instead Algorithms \ref{alg:udo} and \ref{alg:vcd} proceed heuristically to convert a nodal active set indicator $\nu_h$ (Definition \ref{def:nodalactive}) into an element marking $I_h$ (Definition \ref{def:marking}), with the goal of improving the approximation of the free boundary.

The use of PETSc DMPlex queries is essential to Algorithm \ref{alg:udo} below, so let us sketch aspects of how this domain management class supports unstructured meshes \cite{Langeetal2016}.  A DMPlex object stores the topology (connectivity of entities) of a $d=1,2,3$ FE mesh.  Every mesh entity, regardless of dimension, is assigned a unique index.  Mesh connectivity can be understood as a stratified directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which a covering (incidence) relationship between mesh entities determines the directed edges.  For example, a triangle within a 2D mesh is covered by its three edges, each of which is covered by its two endpoints (vertices).  Each stratum in the DAG represents a dimensional class of mesh entity, thus the cells, edges, and vertices in a 2D mesh are at strata indices (heights) of $0$, $1$, and $2$ respectively.  Given the index $p$ of a mesh entity, we will use the following DMPlex mesh topology queries \cite{petsc-user-ref}:  The operation $\text{\emph{cone}}(p)$ returns the indices of all entities which cover entity $p$.  Its dual, which returns all the entities which are covered by $p$, is $\text{\emph{support}}(p)$.  The transitive closure of \emph{cone} is $\text{\emph{closure}}(p)$, and that of \emph{support} is $\text{\emph{star}}(p)$.  In our application we need only the indices of vertices in the element closure; we denote this as $\text{\emph{closure}}^\wedge(k)$.  Similarly, $\text{\emph{star}}_\vee(j)$ extracts only element indices in the star of vertex $x_j$.

The Unstructured Dilation Operator (UDO) method, Algorithm \ref{alg:udo}, first computes a nodal active set indicator $\nu_h$.  Denoting the degrees of freedom in $\DG_0(\cT_h)$ by $x_k$, it finds the set of indices $k$ of elements such that $0<\nu_h(x_k)<1$.  If $u_h \in \CG_1$ then this condition holds when the element is incident to both active and inactive vertices.  Then the method alternates closure and star on the element set $n$ times, expanding the marking by $n$ element layers, to generate an element marking $I_h$.

\begin{algorithm}[ht]
	\caption{Unstructured Dilation Operator (UDO) element marking}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Require mesh $\cT_h$, solution $u_h \in \cK_h$, obstacle $\psi_h \in \cX_h$, tolerance $\text{tol} > 0$, and expansion parameter $n\ge 1$.
		\State Compute nodal active set indicator $\nu_h \in \cX_h$.
		\State Find initial element index set $S_0$: \,$k\in S_0$ if $\nu_h(x_k) \in (0,1)$.
		\For{$i=0,\dots,n-1$}
		    $$S_{i+1} = \bigcup_{k\in S_i}\, \bigcup_{j\in \text{\emph{closure}}^\wedge(k)} \text{\emph{star}}_\vee(j)$$
		\EndFor \\
		\Return marking $I_h \in \DG_0(\cT_h)$ of all elements with indices in $S_n$.
	\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:udo}
\end{algorithm}

The main motivation of the UDO method is that if the approximation $u_h\approx u$ is good for a non-degenerate VI problem \eqref{eq:vi} then the free boundary $\Gamma_u$ should pass through, or close to, the elements indicated \emph{a posteriori} by $I_h$.  Indeed, in the results Sections \ref{sec:results} and \ref{sec:app} we only consider $n=1$ and $n=2$, as this much expansion seems to suffice for accurate representation of the free boundary under a few refinements.

The UDO strategy explicitly manipulates the indices of mesh entities.  Our second strategy, called Variable Coefficient Diffusion (VCD) and shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:vcd}, is a smoothed approximation of UDO.  It has the same essential intent, namely to generate a marking $I_h$ for elements near the computed free boundary, but it operates at the level of FE functions and not indices.  Again the first step computes a nodal active set indicator $\nu_h \in \CG_1$, but now this function is used as the initial condition of a time-dependent, variable-coefficient diffusion equation
\begin{equation} \label{eq:diffusioneqn}
\frac{\partial s}{\partial t} = \Div\left(D \grad s\right), \qquad s(t=0) = \nu_h,
\end{equation}
with Neumann (natural) boundary conditions, a well-posed problem.  A solution of \eqref{eq:diffusioneqn} at any $t>0$ is a smoothed form of $\nu_h$.  The diffusivity here is set to the square of the element diameter, $D=C h^2$ with $C=0.5$ by default; $h=h(k)$ varies over the mesh and $h,D \in \DG_0(\cT_h)$.  The diffusion range is thus proportional to one element diameter everywhere along the free boundary, largely independent of element geometry and dimension.  In fact \eqref{eq:diffusioneqn} is not solved exactly, or even very accurately, as we only compute $s_h\in\cX_h$ from a single backward-Euler step of duration $\Delta t = 1$.  The default solver for this linear and elliptic problem is four iterations of conjugate gradient, preconditioned by incomplete-Cholesky factorization \cite{Bueler2021}.  This approximate solver is inexpensive, and its complexity is linear in the number of nodes.

\begin{algorithm}[ht]
	\caption{Variable Coefficient Diffusion (VCD) element marking}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Require mesh $\cT_h$, solution $u_h \in \cK_h$, obstacle $\psi_h \in \cX_h$, tolerance $\text{tol} > 0$, coefficient $C>0$, and threshold interval $0 < \alpha < \beta < 1$.
		\State Compute nodal active set indicator $\nu_h \in \cX_h$.
		\State For $h$ the element diameter, let $D=C h^2 \in \DG_0(\cT_h)$.
		\State Approximately solve for $s_h\in\cX_h$, with Neumann boundary conditions:
		  $$s_h - \Div(D \grad s_h) = \nu_h$$ \\
		\Return marking $I_h \in \DG_0(\cT_h)$ of all elements such that $s_h(x_k) \in (\alpha,\beta)$.
    \end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:vcd}
\end{algorithm}

Figure \ref{fig:vcdillustration} illustrates how the VCD algorithm applies to a one-dimensional obstacle problem.  Note that there are parameters to consider with this technique, especially the thresholds $\alpha$ and $\beta$, with defaults $0.2$ and $0.8$, respectively.  Lowering $\alpha$ toward zero increases the resolution in the inactive set near the (computed) free boundary, while increasing $\beta$ toward one increases resolution on the active set side.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\input{tikz/vcdfour.tex}
\caption{Illustration of VCD: \emph{(a)} The function $u_h$ (solid) is an approximate solution to \eqref{eq:fe:vi}, with nodes $x_j$ shown (solid dots), and obstacle $\psi_h$ (red dashed).  \emph{(b)} Nodal active set indicator $\nu_h \in \CG_1(\cT_h)$, with values in $\{0,1\}$.  \emph{(c)} Smoothed indicator $s_h$ (solid), with element degrees of freedom $x_k$ (circles) and thresholding levels shown (red).  \emph{(d)} Element marking $I_h$; 4 elements are marked for refinement.}
\label{fig:vcdillustration}
\end{figure}

It turns out to be helpful, especially when solving highly-nonlinear obstacle problems like that in Section \ref{sec:app}, to have the user of Algorithms \ref{alg:udo} and \ref{alg:vcd} also set a minimum element diameter $\hmin$.  To implement this bound, after running these Algorithms we (un)set the indicator for element $K$, i.e.~we set $I_h|_K=0$, for any element with $h_K < \hmin$.

From the marking $I_h$, computed by either Algorithm, we then apply \emph{skeleton-based refinement} (SBR) \cite{PlazaCarey2000} to generate a refined mesh with no hanging nodes and good mesh quality.  Note that two implementations of SBR are available to Firedrake applications, namely from the DMPlex component of PETSc \cite{petsc-user-ref} or the Netgen library \cite{Betteridgeetal2024}; only the latter is (currently) capable of 3D refinement.

Our third AMR method is based on \emph{metric-based mesh adaptation} \cite{Alauzet2010}.  Instead of marking elements for refinement, mesh adaptation generates a new mesh matching resolution and complexity targets, for example keeping the mesh complexity approximately constant.  Here adaptation is driven by an \emph{a posteriori} computed metric ﬁeld, which is a continuous, matrix-valued function $M_h:\Omega \to \RR^{d\times d}$, with each value $M_h(x)$ a symmetric and positive-definite matrix.  Such a metric contains local information on distances, areas, and volumes \cite{LoseilleAlauzet2011}, and from the metric the mesher itself generates a unit mesh \cite{Alauzet2010}.  The resulting mesh has variable and anisotropic edge lengths in the original space.

Our \emph{averaged-metric} (AVM; Algorithm \ref{alg:avm}) AMR method for VIs again starts from $u_h$ and $\psi_h$.  The first metric is isotropic, and it is computed from the gradient of a smoothed nodal active set indicator, namely $s_h$ from the VCD method (Algorithm \ref{alg:vcd}).  The second metric is anisotropic, computed as an approximate Hessian of $u_h$ via a Hessian-recovery technique \cite{Alauzet2010}.  (Generally the FE function $u_h$ has discontinuous first derivatives and no well-defined Hessian.)  Actually the absolute value of the Hessian is used, which well-defined for a symmetric matrix \cite{Wallworketal2020}.  These metrics are in the matrix-valued $\CG_1$ FE space, with metric normalization constants computed from target complexity and eleemnt diameter bounds in a standard manner \cite{Wallworketal2020}.  By construction, the first metric should imply small elements near the free boundary, while the second should reduce FE approximation error, specifically in the inactive set, according to the standard interpolation theory \cite{Ciarlet2002}.  The final metric seen by the mesher is a weighted average of the two metrics, and thus it is an anisotropic metric which is free-boundary aware.

\begin{algorithm}[ht]
	\caption{Averaged-metric (AVM) mesh adaptation}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Require mesh $\cT_h$, solution $u_h \in \cK_h$, obstacle $\psi_h \in \cX_h$, target complexity $N$, element diameter bounds $0<\hmin<\hmax$, and averaging parameter $0\le \gamma \le 1$
		\State Compute $s_h \in \cX_h$ from Algorithm \ref{alg:vcd}, using $u_h,\psi_h$.
		\State Compute normalized isotropic free-boundary metric: $M_1(x)=c_1 |\grad s_h(x)| I_{d\times d}$.
		\State Compute normalized anisotropic metric from Hessian: $M_2(x)=c_2 |H u_h(x)|$.
		\State Average the metrics: $M(x) = \gamma M_1(x) + (1-\gamma) M_2(x)$. \\
		\Return new mesh $\tilde \cT_h$ which is unit with respect to $M(x)$.
    \end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:avm}
\end{algorithm}

Note that our implementation of Algorithm \ref{alg:avm} calls the Animate library (\href{https://github.com/mesh-adaptation/animate}{{\small \texttt{github.com/mesh-adaptation/animate}}}) to construct, normalize, and average the metrics.  Furthmermore, Animate uses the Pragmatic library (\href{https://github.com/meshadaptation/pragmatic}{{\small \texttt{github.com/meshadaptation/pragmatic}}}) as the default metric-based mesher.

The right-hand image in Figure \ref{fig:threeballmeshes} (Introduction) shows an AVM result on the ``ball'' obstacle problem, which is the same problem as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ball}, and in the middle image of Figure \ref{fig:activesizes}.  Note that iterating the AVM method, even while holding the target mesh complexity constant, can be worthwhile because the increased resolution near the free boundary allows the \emph{a posteriori} metric to become more effective.  However, because of the many nontrivial computations in metric-based methods \cite{Alauzet2010,Wallworketal2020}, one AVM iteration is notably more expensive than an iteration of UDO or VCD; see Section \ref{sec:results}.

All three methods, UDO, VCD, and AVM, run in parallel under the MPI process model used by Firedrake/PETSc \cite{Bueler2021,Langeetal2016}.  However, only UDO produces results which are independent of the number of processes $P$.  The VCD method can be configured to have this property by choosing a direct solver for problem \eqref{eq:diffusioneqn}, but this reduces scalability.  In fact a preconditioned Krylov solver is preferred for VCD performance even though its default parallel block preconditioner generates slightly different results depending on $P$ \cite{Bueler2021}.

We end this section with two basic Python examples which illustrate how the open source VIAMR library (\href{https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/VI-AMR}{{\small \texttt{github.com/StefanoFochesatto/VI-AMR}}}) is used.

\begin{example} \label{example:AOL}
Consider now Example 1 from \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993}, a classical obstacle problem over a rectangle, with obstacle $\psi=0$ and a known exact solution.  The complete code below applies the Firedrake and VIAMR libraries to solve this problem.  First it generates a uniform coarse mesh, then it applies VCD marking for the free boundary, and then it refines to a new mesh (Figure \ref{fig:resultAOL}).  For this example there is no refinement in the inactive set.
\inputminted[linenos, frame=lines]{python}{../examples/aol.py}
\end{example}

\caption{The Python code in Example \ref{example:AOL} solves Example 1 from \cite{AinsworthOdenLee1993}: initial mesh (left), marking by the default-parameter VCD scheme (middle), and the refined mesh (right).  The exact free boundary, unknown to the algorithm, is overlaid in black.}
\label{fig:resultAOL}
\end{figure}

\begin{example} \label{example:hybrid}
The following code snippet was used in generating the left-hand mesh in Figure \ref{fig:threeballmeshes}:
\begin{minted}[linenos, frame=lines]{python}
amr = VIAMR()
fbmark = amr.udomark(uh, psih, n=1)
residual = -div(grad(uh))
imark, _, _ = amr.brinactivemark(uh, psih, residual, theta=0.7)
mark = amr.unionmarks(fbmark, imark)
refinedmesh = amr.refinemarkedelements(mesh, mark)
\end{minted}
Here the $n=1$ case of UDO is used to mark near the free boundary, then the BR error indicator (Section \ref{sec:inactive}), using the element-wise residual, is applied for marking in the inactive set, and finally these marks are unioned.
\end{example}


\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
In this section we will discuss the results of applying our new AMR methods to various obstacle problems. To do so, we must first describe the way in which we are measuring the geometric convergence of the free boundary. The VIAMR library provides two geometric measures of convergence: the Hausdorff distance and the Jaccard index. We will proceed by describing only the Jaccard index method as its implementation is simpler, relies solely on the Firedrake FE library, and works in parallel for meshes with compatable distributions of elements across processes. 

\subsection{The Jaccard index} \label{sec:jaccard}
The Jaccard index is a similarilty measure on sets, defined as
\begin{equation}
J(A, B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
	J(\emptyset, \emptyset) := 1
\end{equation}
Note that $J(\cdot, \cdot) \in [0, 1]$ where $J = 1$ indicates that A and B are identical, and $J = 0$ indicates otherwise.   

In our application of the Jaccard index to measure the convergence of the free boundary we assume that the convergence of the active and inactive sets implies the convergence of the free boundary. (when does this not happen? space filling free boundary? fractal boundary)

Computation of the Jaccard index is implemented in the VIAMR library as the function \texttt{jaccard()}. This function takes two element-wise active/inactive set indicators $A$ and $B$ defined on $\DG_0(\cT_A)$ and $\DG_0(\cT_B)$ respectively and computes the jaccard index via the following integrals, where $A$ and $B$ are the two indicators, 

\begin{equation}
	J(A, B) = \frac{\int_{\Omega} AB }{\int_{\Omega} A + B - AB}.
\end{equation}

These integrals are computed element-wise over $\tau_A$ and $B$ is projected into $\DG_0(\cT_A)$ via an L2 conservative supermesh projection(reading through the implementation is interesting because the supermesh projection of an indicator function literally ends up beingf the fractions of how an active element in B is split into elements in A which is cool and exactly the dream operation that makes this work) FIXME cite farrell 

To demonstrate the use of the Jaccard index, and the effectiveness of our proposed methods we consider two particular problems. 




%% Qualitative assesment of AMR methods. 
We will present the three 2D classical obstacle problems whose active sets are depicted in Example 1.2. The first is the is the "spiral" problem, which is a modification of the homogeneous Dirichlet classical Laplacian obstacle problem as described in Section 1 in which the obstacle formulation is given by, 
\begin{equation}
  \psi(r, \theta) = \sin(2\pi/r + \pi/2 - \theta) + \frac{r(r + 1)}{r - 2} - 3r + 3.6,
\end{equation}
and $\psi(0, \theta) = 3.6$.

}
\caption{}
\label{fig:spiralmeshfig}
\end{figure}




The second is the "blisters" problem, which is another unilateral obstacle problem but with the "blistering" property as described in Appendix A. To summarize this example has $\psi = 0$, and nonegative source term $f$ with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions.

\end{figure}





The third is the "L-shaped" problem, which is a homogeneous Dirichlet classical Laplacian obstacle problem with an L-shaped domain. The interior corner of this domain, demonstrates the need to both refine the mesh with a FB aware strategy and use a traditional a posteriori AMR technique on the inactive set to capture the singularity.

\section{Application to determining glaciated land areas} \label{sec:app}

In this section we apply AMR techniques from Sections \ref{sec:inactive} and \ref{sec:viamr} to a model for the steady geometry of a glacier, over a given bedrock topography and subject to a given climate.  This model finds which land is covered by ice and what is the ice volume.  Though glacier will cover any land on which snowfall exceeds melt, ice flow expands the ice-covered area out to a free boundary, the glacier margin, which can only be found by solving conservation equations.  Any fluid layer subject to surface processes which add or remove mass is governed by such a model \cite{Bueler2021b}.  In these VI problems, which generally are \emph{not} of optimization type, the unknown fluid thickness must be nonnegative, the operator is nonlinear, and the blistering property (Appendix \ref{app:blistering}) applies.

Let $\Omega \subset \RR^2$ be a fixed land region, with bedrock elevation $b=b(x,y) \in C^1(\Omega)$.  Assume there is a surface mass-balance \cite{GreveBlatter2009} function $a:\Omega \times \RR \to \RR$.  This climatic function models the annually-averaged rate of ice accumulation (snow) minus melt and runoff.  If $a$ depends on the surface elevation $s$ then we suppose that $a(x,y,s)\in L^\infty(\Omega)$ for any $s=s(x,y) \in L^\infty(\Omega)$, and additionally that $a$ is Lipschitz continuous in $s$.

We use an ice flow approximation called the \emph{shallow ice approximation} \cite{GreveBlatter2009}, derived by a thin-layer argument from mass and momentum conservation, in its simplest isothermal and non-sliding case.  Applying the standard exponent for the shear-thinning flow law of ice \cite{GreveBlatter2009}, we have a VI for admissible transformed ice thickness functions $u \in \cK = \{u \in \cX\,:\,u\ge 0 \text{ and } u|_{\partial\Omega}=0\}$, in the Banach space $\cX = W^{1,4}(\Omega)$ \cite{JouvetBueler2012}.  The thickness itself is $H=u^{3/8}$, while the surface elevation is $s=H+b=u^{3/8}+b$.  The model is a VI based upon a ``tilted'' variation of the $p$-Laplacian operator \cite{JouvetBueler2012}:
\begin{equation}
\int_\Omega \Gamma |\grad u + \bm{\beta}(u)|^2 (\grad u + \bm{\beta}(u)) \cdot \grad (v-u) - \tilde a(u) (v-u)\,dx \ge 0 \label{eq:sia:vi}
\end{equation}
for all $v \in \cK$.  Here $\Gamma>0$ is an ice softness constant, $\bm{\beta}(u)=\frac{8}{3} u^{5/8} \grad b$ is a nonlinear multiple of the bed gradient, and $\tilde a(u)=a(x,y,u^{3/8}+b(x,y))$ denotes the surface mass balance (with $x,y$ dependence suppressed).  When $\grad b=0$, \eqref{eq:sia:vi} defines a nonlinear operator $F(v)[w]$ which is $4$-coercive \cite{JouvetBueler2012}; recall definition \eqref{eq:coercive}.  If $a$ has no $s$ dependence then one may treat it as the source term, and write ``$F(u)[v-u]\ge\ell[v-u]$'' as in \eqref{eq:vi}, but otherwise we simply set $\ell=0$ in \eqref{eq:vi}.

Regarding the mathematical theory of \eqref{eq:sia:vi}, existence holds for any $b$ when $a$ is independent of $s$ \cite{JouvetBueler2012}.  Simple cases of \emph{non}-existence are known wherein $a$ depends on $s$ \cite{Jouvetetal2011}, but our examples below have slow increase of snowfall with elevation \cite{GreveBlatter2009}, avoiding the issue.  The strong-form interior condition of \eqref{eq:sia:vi} is a conservation equation:
\begin{equation}
\Div \bq = \tilde a \text{ over } I_u, \quad \text{where } \bq = - \Gamma |\grad u + \bm{\beta}(u)|^2 (\grad u + \bm{\beta}(u)).
\label{eq:sia:interior}
\end{equation}
At the free boundary (glacier margin) the solution $u$, the solution gradient $|\grad u|$, and the flux $\bq$ all go to zero.  On the other hand, observations confirm that the gradient of a glacier's surface has large magnitude as one approaches the margin from the ice side, a property which emerges from \eqref{eq:sia:vi} when one differentiates the associated surface elevation $s=u^{3/8} + b$, and in fact generally $|\grad s| \to \infty$ at the glacier margin.

We apply a conforming, continuous, piecewise-linear FE method \eqref{eq:fe:vi}, over unstructured triangulations.  The FE problem is either solved directly by the same VI-adapted Newton solver (\texttt{vinewtonrsls} in PETSc \cite{petsc-user-ref}) used in Section \ref{sec:results}, or with an added outer Picard-type iteration over the tilt $\bm{\beta}(u)$ \cite{JouvetBueler2012} and source $\tilde a(u)$, with Newton as the inner iteration.  The linear Newton steps are solved directly.  Very similar results are obtained when both converge, but the Picard-based solver is more robust when $|\grad b|$ is large or $\tilde a$ depends on $u$.

We consider two particular problems, each over a square domain $\Omega=(0,L)^2$, $L=1800$ kilometers.  The first ``dome'' problem has a flat bed, elevation-independent source, and a known exact solution \cite{Bueler2016}; this is used for verification and to compare AMR algorithms.  The second ``realistic'' problem has a bumpy bed and an elevation-dependent surface mass balance function.

\begin{example} \label{example:dome}
The dome problem was solved with 13 levels of refinement from an initial, uniform $h_0=360$ kilometer mesh to a final mesh with glacier margin resolution of $h_{13}\approx 30$ meters.  Both UDO and VCD methods (Section \ref{sec:viamr}) were applied, with GR marking in the inactive set (Section \ref{sec:inactive}).  Figure \ref{fig:domenormresults} shows relative $H^1$ errors in the solution ($\|u-u_h\|_{H^1}/\|u\|_{H^1}$) and absolute $L^\infty$ errors in the corresponding ice thickness ($\|H-H_h\|_{L^\infty}$), versus number of elements.  The latter errors are much more responsive to AMR because the physical ice thickness gradient is singular at the free boundary, so (lateral) margin location error is effectively being measured.  Figure \ref{fig:domeradiusresults} shows the maximum radial error for the numerical margin, directly addressing free-boundary localization for the same runs.  We see that AMR methods are much more efficient for this purpose, compared to uniform refinement, and that the UDO and VCD variants perform very similarly.
\end{example}

\caption{AMR generates accurate free boundary locations.  To achieve tens of meters accuracy, as here, uniform refinement would use orders of magnitude more elements.}
\label{fig:domeradiusresults}
\end{figure}

\begin{example} \label{example:realistic}
The next example is more realistic.  It uses a bumpy bedrock topography $b(x,y)$, a finite sum of sinusoids \cite[Example 8.4]{BuelerFarrell2024}, and a surface mass balance function $a(s)$ which depends only on surface elevation.\footnote{For detailed formulas see the source code in \href{https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/VI-AMR/examples/glacier/}{{\scriptsize \texttt{github.com/StefanoFochesatto/VI-AMR/examples/glacier/}}}.}  An important parameter in the formula for $a(s)$ is the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) \cite{GreveBlatter2009}, with $a>0$ above this altitude and $a< 0$ below.  Figure \ref{fig:transect} shows the topography along a transect $x=\hat x$ (red line in Figure \ref{fig:glacier}), with three ELA values $s_0$ superimposed.  Bedrock above the ELA will certainly be glacier-covered, but snowfall occurs on a larger solution-dependent set, namely $S=\{(x,y)\,:\,u(x,y)^{3/8} + b(x,y) > s_0\}$, and glaciation extends beyond $S$ because of flow: $I_u \supset S$.  The difficult nonlinearities in model \eqref{eq:sia:vi} include this elevation-dependent surface mass balance, but also the $u^{5/8}$ dependence in the tilt $\bm{\beta}(u)$.  Among the other effects of the latter nonlinearity is the tendency of ice to pool in bedrock elevation lows.

\caption{Bedrock elevation (solid) along a transect (red in Figure \ref{fig:glacier}, left), with three ELA levels (dashed).}
\label{fig:transect}
\end{figure}

Our primary goals in this example are to generate an accurate map of glaciation, i.e.~of the inactive set $I_u$, to estimate the location of the glacier margin ($\Gamma_u$), and to compute the ice volume $V=\int_\Omega u^{3/8}\,dx\,dy$.  Note that the number of connected components of $I_u$, i.e.~the number of glaciers, is also a model output.

We applied UDO (Algorithm \ref{alg:udo}), with $n=2$ levels, and GR marking in the inactive set.  A minimum element diameter $\hmin=500$ meters (Section \ref{sec:viamr}) was set, with the resulting meshes having about 300 meter resolution along most of the glacier margin.  For ELA values $s_0=1000,800,600$ meters, the resulting surface elevation maps are shown in Figure \ref{fig:glacier}.  The varying ice volumes, $1.1\times 10^5$, $5.6\times 10^5$, and $8.9\times 10^5$ cubic kilometers, respectively, reflect the strong climate (ELA) sensitivity  of realistic glacier models \cite{GreveBlatter2009}.\footnote{Compare the volume of the present-day Greenland ice sheet at $2.9\times 10^6$ cubic kilometers.}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:insetmeshes} shows details of the resulting meshes along sample portions of the glacier margins.  It is key to observe that under the UDO$+$GR AMR approach the mesh was \emph{not} refined in the vast majority of the active set, and this represents a significant efficiency.  That is, we did not waste computational effort (e.g.~elements) on modeling ice which turned out to not be present.  Also we observe that this highly-nonlinear problem causes AMR to work hard to pin down the glacier margin, as only once the inactive side of the margin is resolved at high resolution will its location stabilize.

\section{Discussion and conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

FIXME \emph{Grid Sequencing + AMR targeting the free boundary} is the iterative process for how we are converging to the FB.  The bulk of vinewton iterations are coming from stabilizing the initial iterate's FB and thereafter Grid Sequencing is allowing us to make small adjustments as we refine.  the grid sequencing works best on hierarchal meshes, while with metric method the "grid sequencing" is done through cross-mesh interpolation.

FIXME We have no quantitative theory (norm bounds) telling us how the two strategies interact.  We are applying two different, well-defined, marking strategies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item assuming $u_h$ gives an estimate of the free boundary, mark nearby elements on both sides of the free boundary
\item assuming $u_h$ gives an estimate of the inactive set, mark in this approximate inactive set according to PDE principles
\end{enumerate}
Note that i) has nothing directly to do with the regularity (or residual) in $u_h$.  Regardless of the smoothness of $u_h$ near the free boundary, or the magnitude of the residual from $u_h$, we want to mark near the free boundary.

FIXME VI solver performance can be substantially improved by combining the AMR meshing strategies here with a multilevel approach.  The solver in \cite{BuelerFarrell2024}, for example, uses coarse meshes to make large geometrical corrections in the free boundary.  This path, which promises highly-scalable solutions of obstacle problems, is for future research.

\section{Unilateral obstacle problems with the blistering property} \label{app:blistering}

In classical obstacle problem \eqref{eq:classical:vi} an upward force $f(x)>0$ may generally occur in the active set $A_u$.  Physically speaking, an upward force may be insufficient to lift $u$ off a concave obstacle $\psi$.  However, in certain problems this cannot occur.  The hypotheses of Lemma \ref{lem:blister} hold for porous dam saturation free-boundary problems \cite[for example]{AinsworthOdenLee1993} and the glacier problem in Section \ref{sec:app}.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:blister}
Suppose that $\psi=0$ and $\ell[v] = \int_\Omega fv\,dx$ for $f\in L^2(\Omega)$.  Suppose also that the operator $F$ is given by measurable densities: $F(w)[v]=\int_\Omega \phi(w(x),\grad w(x)) v(x) + \Phi(w(x),\grad w(x)) \cdot \grad v(x)\,dx$.  Assume the densities satisfy $\phi(0,0)=0$ and $\Phi(0,0)=0$.  Then for $u$ solving \eqref{eq:vi}, $f\le 0$ a.e.~in $A_u$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $S\subset A_u$ be a Borel set, and denote its indicator function by $\chi_S \in L^\infty(\Omega)$.  By a density argument and the assumptions on $\phi$ and $\Phi$, the operator value $F(u)[\chi_S]$ is well-defined, \emph{and zero}, because $S$ is in the active set.  Thus by Lemma \ref{lem:measure},
\begin{equation*}
0 \le d\mu_u(S) = F(u)[\chi_S]-\ell[\chi_S] = 0 - \ell[\chi_S] = -\int_S f\,dx.
\end{equation*}
This shows $f\le 0$ a.e.~(with respect to Lebesgue measure).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
For a unilateral obstacle problem \eqref{eq:vi} with source term $\ell[v] = \int_\Omega fv\,dx$, $f\in C(\bar \Omega)$, we say that \emph{blistering property} holds if $A_u \subset \{x \in \Omega\, :\, f(x)\le 0\}$ \cite{JouvetBueler2012}, that is, if the conclusion of Lemma \ref{lem:blister} holds.
\end{definition}

To explain the language, if $f(x)>0$ for some $x\in\Omega$ then, assuming this property, the inactive set $I_u$ must be non-empty, and $x\in I_u$.  That is, even a small upward force ``blisters'' the membrane off the obstacle.

Any classical problem \eqref{eq:classical:vi} with a smooth obstacle $\psi\in C^2(\bar\Omega)$ can be transformed into one with the blistering property.  Let $\tilde v=v-\psi$, thus $\tilde\cK = \{\tilde v\in\cX\,:\,\tilde v\ge 0 \text{ and } \tilde v|_{\partial\Omega}=g-\psi|_{\partial\Omega}\}$.  Integration-by-parts shows \eqref{eq:classical:vi} is equivalent to finding $\tilde u = u -\psi \in \tilde \cK$ so that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:classical:vi:blister}
\int_\Omega \nabla \tilde u \cdot \nabla(\tilde v - \tilde u) \ge \int_\Omega \left(f+\grad^2\psi\right)(\tilde v - \tilde u) \quad \text{ for all } \tilde v \in \tilde \cK.
\end{equation}
For VI problem \eqref{eq:classical:vi:blister}, if $x\in A_{\tilde u} = \{\tilde u(x)=0\}$ then $\tilde f(x)= f(x)+\grad^2\psi(x)\le 0$.

For blistering-property problems, AMR costs can be reduced by avoiding refinement in the computed active sets.  Start by identifying the elements $K\in \cT_h$ in the computed active set $A_u^h$.  (In our implementation we require that every node in the closure of $K$ is active, according to some tolerance.)  To identify $K$ where no refinement would be beneficial, the degenerate case must be excluded, so we require $K \subset \Omega_- = \{x\in \Omega\,:\,f(x) < 0\}$; note this uses only the data of the problem.  If later refinements move the free boundary to be incident to $K$ then refinement of $K$ becomes appropriate.

In summary, if a problem has the blistering property, if $f < 0$ on a currently-active element $K$, and if $K$ is far from the free boundary, then $K$ can likely remain unrefined without affecting solution accuracy.  Noting that the techniques of Section \ref{sec:viamr} are designed to mark for refinement those active-set elements which are near $\Gamma_u^h$ in a geometrical sense, one must also recall the necessity of refinement in the inactive set, e.g.~based on indicators from Section \ref{sec:inactive}, to give accuracy $\Gamma_u^h \approx \Gamma_u$.
